%% ABSTRACT -------------------------------------------------------------------
%
\abstract{%
As high-precision asteroseismology modelling of stars continues to advance, it is becoming increasingly important to account for the systematic effects that arise from our assumptions of the stellar helium abundance (\(Y\)) and the mixing-length theory parameter (\(\mlt\)). To address this issue, we present a novel approach for improving the inference of the fundamental parameters of a sample of Kepler dwarfs and subgiants with a narrow mass range of \(0.8 < M < 1.2 \mathrm{M}_{\odot}\). Our method includes a statistical treatment of \(Y\) and \(\mlt\) and employs a hierarchical Bayesian model that incorporates information about the distribution of these parameters in the population. Specifically, we fit a linear helium enrichment law that includes an intrinsic scatter and a normal distribution in \(\mlt\). We explore various levels of pooling parameters, with and without the Sun as a calibrator, and report \(\Delta Y/\Delta Z = 1.05^{+0.28}_{-0.25}\) and \(\mu_\alpha = 1.90^{+0.10}_{-0.09}\) when the Sun is included. Despite accounting for the uncertainties in \(Y\) and \(\mlt\), we are able to report statistical uncertainties of 2.5 per cent in mass, 1.2 per cent in radius, and 12 per cent in age. Moreover, our approach can be extended to larger samples, which would enable us to obtain more precise constraints on the fundamental parameters of individual stars and improve our understanding of the population-level inference.

  % INTERNAL SUPPORT
  I am tremendously grateful to my PhD supervisor Guy R. Davies for his support and excellent mentorship throughout my postgraduate research. I also thank my first co-supervisor Andrea Miglio for his guidence before his move to the University of Bologna. I extend my thanks to Amaury Triaud, who took over from Andrea as my co-supervisor and has since been an inspiring mentor and leader of our research group. It has been a pleasure to work with the Sun, Stars, and Exoplanets research group here at the University of Birmignham. Particularly, I would like to thank all of my fellow current and former PhD students with whom I have exchanged ideas, advice, laughs, and stories: T. Baycroft, L. Carboneau, Y. Davies, A. Dixon, G. Dransfield, A. Freckleton, O. Hall, E. Hatt, V. Hod\v{z}i\'{c}, S. Khan, E. Ross, O. Scutt, M. Standing, W. Van Rossem, and E. Willett. I also appreciate the support of other postdoctoral researchers in our group, notably M. Nielsen, Tanda Li (李坦达), and W. Ball. I extend my thanks to the support staff in the School of Physics and Astronomy, particularly our office secretary Lou for her unwavering support over a challenging few years.
