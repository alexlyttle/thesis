%% ABSTRACT -------------------------------------------------------------------

\abstract{%
  Modelling stars to understand stellar physics and characterise their ages and masses is crucial for studying exoplanetary systems and the evolution of the Milky Way. As stellar modelling advances with the advent of high-precision asteroseismology, it is becoming increasingly important to account for the systematic effects that arise from our physical assumptions. In this thesis, I present a novel approach for improving the inference of fundamental stellar parameters using a hierarchical Bayesian model. I introduce a statistical treatment which `pools' helium abundance (\(Y\)) and the mixing-length theory parameter (\(\mlt\)) to incorporate information about their distributions in the population. Specifically, I model \(Y\) as a distribution with a mean from a linear helium enrichment law parametrised by \(\Delta Y/\Delta Z\). I test our method on a sample of dwarfs and subgiants observed by \emph{Kepler} with a narrow mass range of \(0.8 < M/\mathrm{M}_{\odot} < 1.2\). Exploring various levels of pooling parameters, with and without the Sun as a calibrator, I report \(\Delta Y/\Delta Z = 1.05^{+0.28}_{-0.25}\) when the Sun is included in the sample. Despite marginalising over uncertainties in \(Y\) and \(\mlt\), I am able to report statistical uncertainties of 2.5 per cent in mass, 1.2 per cent in radius, and 12 per cent in age. Moreover, my approach can be extended to larger samples, enabling further uncertainty reduction in fundamental parameters and an improved characterisation of population-level distributions.

  There is additional information on \(Y\) to be gained from detailed asteroseismology. Acoustic glitches, which arise from rapid changes in stellar structure (e.g. from helium ionisation), leave a periodic signature in the mode frequencies (\(\nu_{nl}\)) in solar-like oscillators. I present a new method for modelling acoustic glitch signatures in the radial mode frequencies using a Gaussian Process (GP). The GP provides a statistical treatment of uncertainty in the smooth component of our model for \(\nu_{nl}\) as a function of radial order, \(n\). Using a model star and 16 Cyg A, I compare this approach to another method which models the smooth component with a 4th-order polynomial. My results show that the GP method accurately determines the strength and location of acoustic glitches caused by He\,\textsc{ii} ionisation and the base of the convective zone. I find that using a prior to inform the glitch parameters in my method reduces the occurrence of extreme, unrealistic solutions in the posterior. Furthermore, I demonstrate that the GP approach outperforms the polynomial by absorbing the lesser signature of He\,\textsc{i} ionisation in the modes. However, the inclusion of the He\,\textsc{i} ionisation glitch in the model remains a question. Overall, my results suggest that the GP method should be further tested on more solar-like oscillators and then integrated into the hierarchical model presented in this work.}
