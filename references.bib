  abstract = {TensorFlow is a machine learning system that operates at large scale and in heterogeneous environments. TensorFlow uses dataflow graphs to represent computation, shared state, and the operations that mutate that state. It maps the nodes of a dataflow graph across many machines in a cluster, and within a machine across multiple computational devices, including multicore CPUs, general-purpose GPUs, and custom designed ASICs known as Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). This architecture gives flexibility to the application developer: whereas in previous "parameter server" designs the management of shared state is built into the system, TensorFlow enables developers to experiment with novel optimizations and training algorithms. TensorFlow supports a variety of applications, with particularly strong support for training and inference on deep neural networks. Several Google services use TensorFlow in production, we have released it as an open-source project, and it has become widely used for machine learning research. In this paper, we describe the TensorFlow dataflow model in contrast to existing systems, and demonstrate the compelling performance that TensorFlow achieves for several real-world applications.},

  abstract = {We report the discovery of a warm sub-Saturn, TOI-257b (HD 19916b), based on data from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). The transit signal was detected by TESS and confirmed to be of planetary origin based on radial velocity observations. An analysis of the TESS photometry, the MINERVA-Australis, FEROS, and HARPS radial velocities, and the asteroseismic data of the stellar oscillations reveals that TOI-257b has a mass of MP = 0.138 {$\pm$} 0.023 \$\textbackslash rm \{M\_J\}\$ (43.9 {$\pm$} 7.3 \$\textbackslash, M\_\{\textbackslash rm \textbackslash oplus\}\$ ), a radius of RP = 0.639 {$\pm$} 0.013 \$\textbackslash rm \{R\_J\}\$ (7.16 {$\pm$} 0.15 \$\textbackslash, \textbackslash mathrm\{ R\}\_\{\textbackslash rm \textbackslash oplus\}\$ ), bulk density of \$0.65\^\{+0.12\}\_\{-0.11\}\$ (cgs), and period \$18.38818\^\{+0.00085\}\_\{-0.00084\}\$ \$\textbackslash rm \{days\}\$ . TOI-257b orbits a bright (V = 7.612 mag) somewhat evolved late F-type star with M* = 1.390 {$\pm$} 0.046 \$\textbackslash rm \{M\_\{sun\}\}\$ , R* = 1.888 {$\pm$} 0.033 \$\textbackslash rm \{R\_\{sun\}\}\$ , Teff = 6075 {$\pm$} 90 \$\textbackslash rm \{K\}\$ , and vsin i = 11.3 {$\pm$} 0.5 km s-1. Additionally, we find hints for a second non-transiting sub-Saturn mass planet on a {$\sim$}71 day orbit using the radial velocity data. This system joins the ranks of a small number of exoplanet host stars ({$\sim$}100) that have been characterized with asteroseismology. Warm sub-Saturns are rare in the known sample of exoplanets, and thus the discovery of TOI-257b is important in the context of future work studying the formation and migration history of similar planetary systems.},

  abstract = {The last two decades have seen a major expansion in the availability, size, and precision of time-domain datasets in astronomy. Owing to their unique combination of flexibility, mathematical simplicity and comparative robustness, Gaussian Processes (GPs) have emerged recently as the solution of choice to model stochastic signals in such datasets. In this review we provide a brief introduction to the emergence of GPs in astronomy, present the underlying mathematical theory, and give practical advice considering the key modelling choices involved in GP regression. We then review applications of GPs to time-domain datasets in the astrophysical literature so far, from exoplanets to active galactic nuclei, showcasing the power and flexibility of the method. We provide worked examples using simulated data, with links to the source code, discuss the problem of computational cost and scalability, and give a snapshot of the current ecosystem of open source GP software packages. Driven by further algorithmic and conceptual advances, we expect that GPs will continue to be an important tool for robust and interpretable time domain astronomy for many years to come.},

  abstract = {The fourth generation of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-IV) began  observations in 2014 July. It pursues three core programs: the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment 2 (APOGEE-2), Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO (MaNGA), and the Extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS). As well as its core program, eBOSS contains two major subprograms: the Time Domain Spectroscopic Survey (TDSS) and the SPectroscopic IDentification of ERosita Sources (SPIDERS). This paper describes the first data release from SDSS-IV, Data Release 13 (DR13). DR13 makes publicly available the first 1390 spatially resolved integral field unit observations of nearby galaxies from MaNGA. It includes new observations from eBOSS, completing the Sloan Extended QUasar, Emission-line galaxy, Luminous red galaxy Survey (SEQUELS), which also targeted variability-selected objects and X-ray-selected objects. DR13 includes new reductions of the SDSS-III BOSS data, improving the spectrophotometric calibration and redshift classification, and new reductions of the SDSS-III APOGEE-1 data, improving stellar parameters for dwarf stars and cooler stars. DR13 provides more robust and precise photometric calibrations. Value-added target catalogs relevant for eBOSS, TDSS, and SPIDERS and an updated red-clump catalog for APOGEE are also available. This paper describes the location and format of the data and provides references to important technical papers. The SDSS web site, http://www.sdss.org, provides links to the data, tutorials, examples of data access, and extensive documentation of the reduction and analysis procedures. DR13 is the first of a scheduled set that will contain new data and analyses from the planned {$\sim$}6 yr operations of SDSS-IV.},

  abstract = {Converting a noisy parallax measurement into a posterior belief over distance requires inference with a prior. Usually, this prior represents beliefs about the stellar density distribution of the Milky Way. However, multiband photometry exists for a large fraction of the Gaia-TGAS Catalog and is incredibly informative about stellar distances. Here, we use 2MASS colors for 1.4 million TGAS stars to build a noise-deconvolved empirical prior distribution for stars in color-magnitude space. This model contains no knowledge of stellar astrophysics or the Milky Way but is precise because it accurately generates a large number of noisy parallax measurements under an assumption of stationarity; that is, it is capable of combining the information from many stars. We use the Extreme Deconvolution (XD) algorithm\textemdash which is an empirical-Bayes approximation to a full-hierarchical model of the true parallax and photometry of every star\textemdash to construct this prior. The prior is combined with a TGAS likelihood to infer a precise photometric-parallax estimate and uncertainty (and full posterior) for every star. Our parallax estimates are more precise than the TGAS catalog entries by a median factor of 1.2 (14\% are more precise by a factor {$>$}2) and they are more precise than the previous Bayesian distance estimates that use spatial priors. We validate our parallax inferences using members of the Milky Way star cluster M67, which is not visible as a cluster in the TGAS parallax estimates but appears as a cluster in our posterior parallax estimates. Our results, including a parallax posterior probability distribution function for each of 1.4 million TGAS stars, are available in companion electronic tables.},

The growth or damping rates of oscillations are determined from the imaginary part of eigenfrequencies. The radiative transfer of perturbations is treated by the Eddington approximation which is applicable both for the optically thick and thin cases. Results of stability analysis are shown in the diagnostic diagram and compared with the observed power spectra of the five-minute oscillation. It is found that many of the acoustic modes are overstable mainly due to the so-called Kappa-mechanism of the hydrogen ionization zone, while atmospheric radiation loss plays an important part in the stability of higher overtones. Unstable modes occupy a long mountain-range-like region in the diagnostic diagram centered with a period of 300 sec and with a wide range of wavelength.},

Aims: The derivation of stellar parameters has usually been done with single stars. The aim of the paper is to derive the stellar parameters of a double-star system (HIP 93511), for which an interferometric orbit has been observed along with asteroseismic measurements. Methods: We used a time series of nearly two years of data for the double star to detect the two oscillation-mode envelopes that appear in the power spectrum. Using a new scaling relation based on luminosity, we derived the radius and mass of each star. We derived the age of each star using two proxies: one based upon the large frequency separation and a new one based upon the small frequency separation. Using stellar modelling, the mode frequencies allowed us to derive the radius, the mass, and the age of each component. In addition, speckle interferometry performed since 2006 has enabled us to recover the orbit of the system and the total mass of the system. Results: From the determination of the orbit, the total mass of the system is 2.34-0.33+0.45 M{$\odot$}. The total seismic mass using scaling relations is 2.47 {$\pm$} 0.07 M{$\odot$}. The seismic age derived using the new proxy based upon the small frequency separation is 3.5 {$\pm$} 0.3 Gyr. Based on stellar modelling, the mean common age of the system is 2.7-3.9 Gyr. The mean total seismic mass of the system is 2.34-2.53 M{$\odot$} consistent with what we determined independently with the orbit. The stellar models provide the mean radius, mass, and age of the stars as RA = 1.82-1.87R{$\odot$}, MA = 1.25-1.39 M{$\odot$}, AgeA = 2.6-3.5 Gyr; RB = 1.22-1.25 R{$\odot$}, MB = 1.08-1.14 M{$\odot$}, AgeB = 3.35-4.21 Gyr. The models provide two sets of values for Star A: [1.25-1.27] M{$\odot$} and [1.34-1.39] M{$\odot$}. We detect a convective core in Star A, while Star B does not have any. For the metallicity of the binary system of Z {$\approx$} 0.02, we set the limit between stars having a convective core in the range [1.14-1.25] M{$\odot$}.

Solar-like oscillations have been observed by Kepler and CoRoT  in several solar-type stars, thereby providing a way to probe the stars using asteroseismology Aims: We provide the mode frequencies of the oscillations of various stars required to perform a comparison with those obtained from stellar modelling. Methods: We used a time series of nine months of data for each star. The 61 stars observed were categorised in three groups: simple, F-like, and mixed-mode. The simple group includes stars for which the identification of the mode degree is obvious. The F-like group includes stars for which the identification of the degree is ambiguous. The mixed-mode group includes evolved stars for which the modes do not follow the asymptotic relation of low-degree frequencies. Following this categorisation, the power spectra of the 61 main-sequence and subgiant stars were analysed using both maximum likelihood estimators and Bayesian estimators, providing individual mode characteristics such as frequencies, linewidths, and mode heights. We developed and describe a methodology for extracting a single set of mode frequencies from multiple sets derived by different methods and individual scientists. We report on how one can assess the quality of the fitted parameters using the likelihood ratio test and the posterior probabilities. Results: We provide the mode frequencies of 61 stars (with their 1-{$\sigma$} error bars), as well as their associated \'echelle diagrams.

  abstract = {The solar chemical composition is an important ingredient in our understanding of the formation, structure, and evolution of both the Sun and our Solar System. Furthermore, it is an essential reference standard against which the elemental contents of other astronomical objects are compared. In this review, we evaluate the current understanding of the solar photospheric composition. In particular, we present a redetermination of the abundances of nearly all available elements, using a realistic new three-dimensional (3D), time-dependent hydrodynamical model of the solar atmosphere. We have carefully considered the atomic input data and selection of spectral lines, and accounted for departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) whenever possible. The end result is a comprehensive and homogeneous compilation of the solar elemental abundances. Particularly noteworthy findings are significantly lower abundances of C, N, O, and Ne compared to the widely used values of a decade ago. The new solar chemical composition is supported by a high degree of internal consistency between available abundance indicators, and by agreement with values obtained in the Solar Neighborhood and from the most pristine meteorites. There is, however, a stark conflict with standard models of the solar interior according to helioseismology, a discrepancy that has yet to find a satisfactory resolution.}

  abstract = {Observations of helium and hydrogen emission lines from metal-poor extragalactic H II regions, combined with estimates of metallicity, provide an independent method for determining the primordial helium abundance, Yp. Traditionally, the emission lines employed are in the visible wavelength range, and the number of suitable lines is limited. Furthermore, when using these lines, large systematic uncertainties in helium abundance determinations arise due to the degeneracy of physical parameters, such as temperature and density. Recently, Izotov, Thuan, \& Guseva (2014) have pioneered adding the He I {$\lambda$}10830 infrared emission line in helium abundance determinations. The strong electron density dependence of He I {$\lambda$}10830 makes it ideal for better constraining density, potentially breaking the degeneracy with temperature. We revisit our analysis of the dataset published by Izotov, Thuan, \& Stasi\&aposnska (2007) and incorporate the newly available observations of He I {$\lambda$}10830 by scaling them using the observed-to-theoretical Paschen-gamma ratio. The solutions are better constrained, in particular for electron density, temperature, and the neutral hydrogen fraction, improving the model fit to data, with the result that more spectra now pass screening for quality and reliability, in addition to a standard 95\% confidence level cut. Furthermore, the addition of He I {$\lambda$}10830 decreases the uncertainty on the helium abundance for all galaxies, with reductions in the uncertainty ranging from 10-80\%. Overall, we find a reduction in the uncertainty on Yp by over 50\%. From a regression to zero metallicity, we determine Yp = 0.2449 {$\pm$} 0.0040, consistent with the BBN result, Yp = 0.2470 {$\pm$} 0.0002, based on the Planck determination of the baryon density. The dramatic improvement in the uncertainty from incorporating He I {$\lambda$}10830 strongly supports the case for simultaneous (thus not requiring scaling) observations of visible and infrared helium emission line spectra.}

  abstract = {Helium and heavy-element diffusion are both included in precise calculations of solar models. In addition, improvements in the input data for solar interior models are described for nuclear reaction rates, the solar luminosity, the solar age, heavy-element abundances, radiative opacities, helium and metal diffusion rates, and neutrino interaction cross sections. The effects on the neutrino fluxes of each change in the input physics are evaluated separately by constructing a series of solar models with one additional improvement added at each stage. The effective 1 {$\sigma$} uncertainties in the individual input quantities are estimated and used to evaluate the uncertainties in the calculated neutrino fluxes and the calculated event rates for solar neutrino experiments. The calculated neutrino event rates, including all of the improvements, are 9.3+1.2-1.4 SNU for the 37Cl experiment and 137+8-7 SNU for the 71Ga experiments. The calculated flux of 7Be neutrinos is 5.1 (1.00+0.06-0.07)\texttimes 109 cm-2 s-1 and the flux of 8B neutrinos is 6.6(1.00+0.14-0.17)\texttimes 106 cm-2 s-1. The primordial helium abundance found for this model is Y=0.278. The present-day surface abundance of the model is Ys=0.247, in agreement with the helioseismological measurement of Ys=0.242+/-0.003 determined by Hernandez and Christensen-Dalsgaard (1994). The computed depth of the convective zone is R=0.712Rsolar, in agreement with the observed value determined from p-mode oscillation data of R=0.713+/-0.003Rsolar found by Christensen-Dalsgaard et al. (1991). Although the present results increase the predicted event rate in the four operating solar neutrino experiments by almost 1 {$\sigma$} (theoretical uncertainty), they only slightly increase the difficulty of explaining the existing experiments with standard physics (i.e., by assuming that nothing happens to the neutrinos after they are created in the center of the sun). For an extreme model in which all diffusion (helium and heavy-element diffusion) is neglected, the event rates are 7.0+0.9-1.0 SNU for the 37Cl experiment and 126+6-6 SNU for the 71Ga experiments, while the 7Be and 8B neutrino fluxes are, respectively, 4.5(1.00+0.06-0.07)\texttimes 109 cm-2 s-1 and 4.9(1.00+0.14-0.17)\texttimes 106 cm-2 s-1. For the no-diffusion model, the computed value of the depth of the convective zone is R=0.726Rsolar, which disagrees with the observed helioseismological value. The calculated surface abundance of helium, Ys=0.268, is also in disagreement with the p-mode measurement. The authors conclude that helioseismology provides strong evidence for element diffusion and therefore for the somewhat larger solar neutrino event rates calculated in this paper.}

  abstract = {Context. Space-based observations of solar-like oscillations present an opportunity to constrain stellar models using individual mode frequencies. However, current stellar models are inaccurate near the surface, which introduces a systematic difference that must be corrected. Aims: We introduce and evaluate two parametrizations of the surface corrections based on formulae given by Gough (1990, LNP, 367, 283). The first we call a cubic term proportional to {$\nu$}3/ {$\mathscr{I}$} and the second has an additional inverse term proportional to {$\nu$}-1/ {$\mathscr{I}$}, where {$\nu$} and {$\mathscr{I}$} are the frequency and inertia of an oscillation mode. Methods: We first show that these formulae accurately correct model frequencies of two different solar models (Model S and a calibrated MESA model) when compared to observed BiSON frequencies. In particular, even the cubic form alone fits significantly better than a power law. We then incorporate the parametrizations into a modelling pipeline that simultaneously fits the surface effects and the underlying stellar model parameters. We apply this pipeline to synthetic observations of a Sun-like stellar model, solar observations degraded to typical asteroseismic uncertainties, and observations of the well-studied CoRoT target HD 52265. For comparison, we also run the pipeline with the scaled power-law correction proposed by Kjeldsen et al. (2008, ApJ, 683, L175). Results: The fits to synthetic and degraded solar data show that the method is unbiased and produces best-fit parameters that are consistent with the input models and known parameters of the Sun. Our results for HD 52265 are consistent with previous modelling efforts and the magnitude of the surface correction is similar to that of the Sun. The fit using a scaled power-law correction is significantly worse but yields consistent parameters, suggesting that HD 52265 is sufficiently Sun-like for the same power-law to be applicable. Conclusions: We find that the cubic term alone is suitable for asteroseismic applications and it is easy to implement in an existing pipeline. It reproduces the frequency dependence of the surface correction better than a power-law fit, both when comparing calibrated solar models to BiSON observations and when fitting stellar models using the individual frequencies. This parametrization is thus a useful new way to correct model frequencies so that observations of individual mode frequencies can be exploited.},

  abstract = {Context. Accurate modelling of solar-like oscillators requires that modelled mode frequencies are corrected for the systematic shift caused by improper modelling of the near-surface layers, known as the surface effect. Several parametrizations of the surface effect are now available but they have not yet been systematically compared with observations of stars showing modes with mixed g- and p-mode character. Aims: We investigate how much additional uncertainty is introduced to stellar model parameters by our uncertainty about the functional form of the surface effect. At the same time, we test whether any of the parametrizations is significantly better or worse at modelling observed subgiants and low-luminosity red giants. Methods: We model six stars observed by Kepler that show clear mixed modes. We fix the input physics of the stellar models and vary the choice of surface correction between five parametrizations. Results: Models using a solar-calibrated power law correction consistently fit the observations more poorly than the other four corrections. Models with the remaining four corrections generally fit the observations about equally well, with the combined surface correction by Ball \& Gizon perhaps being marginally superior. The fits broadly agree on the model parameters within about the 2{$\sigma$} uncertainties, with discrepancies between the modified Lorentzian and free power law corrections occasionally exceeding the 3{$\sigma$} level. Relative to the best-fitting values, the total uncertainties on the masses, radii and ages of the stars are all less than 2, 1 and 6 per cent, respectively. Conclusions: A solar-calibrated power law, as formulated by Kjeldsen et al., appears unsuitable for use with more evolved solar-like oscillators. Among the remaining surface corrections, the uncertainty in the model parameters introduced by the surface effects is about twice as large as the uncertainty in the individual fits for these six stars. Though the fits are thus somewhat less certain because of our uncertainty of how to manage the surface effect, these results also demonstrate that it is feasible to model the individual mode frequencies of subgiants and low-luminosity red giants, and hence also use these individual stars to help to constrain stellar models.},

Observations of hydrogen and helium radio recombination lines between 8 and 10 GHz were made toward the peak radio continuum position in S206. We derive 4He/H=0.08459+/-0.00088 (random)+/-0.0010 (known systematic), 20\% lower than optical recombination line results. It is difficult to reconcile the large discrepancy between the optical and radio values even when accounting for temperature, density, and ionization structure or for optical extinction by dust. Using only M17 and S206 we determine {$\Delta$}Y/{$\Delta$}Z=1.41+/-0.62 in the Galaxy, consistent with standard chemical evolution models. High helium abundances in the old stellar population of elliptical galaxies can help explain the increase in UV emission with shorter wavelength between 2000 and 1200 \AA, called the ``UV upturn'' or UVX. Our lower values of {$\Delta$}Y/{$\Delta$}Z are consistent with a normal helium abundance at higher metallicity and suggest that other factors, such as a variable red giant branch mass loss with metallicity, may be important. When combined with 4He abundances in metal-poor galaxy H II regions, Magellanic Cloud H II regions, and M17 that have been determined from optical recombination lines, including the effects of temperature fluctuations, our radio 4He/H abundance ratio for S206 is consistent with a helium evolution of {$\Delta$}Y/{$\Delta$}Z=1.6. A linear extrapolation to zero metallicity predicts a 4He/H primordial abundance ratio about 5\% lower than that given by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe and standard big bang nucleosynthesis. The measured 4He abundances may be systematically underestimated by a few percent if clumping exists in these H II regions.},

  abstract = {We study lithium depletion in low-mass and solar-like stars as a  function of time, using a new diffusion coefficient describing extra-mixing taking place at the bottom of a convective envelope. This new form is motivated by multi-dimensional fully compressible, time-implicit hydrodynamic simulations performed with the MUSIC code. Intermittent convective mixing at the convective boundary in a star can be modeled using extreme value theory, a statistical analysis frequently used for finance, meteorology, and environmental science. In this Letter, we implement this statistical diffusion coefficient in a one-dimensional stellar evolution code, using parameters calibrated from multi-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of a young low-mass star. We propose a new scenario that can explain observations of the surface abundance of lithium in the Sun and in clusters covering a wide range of ages, from {$\sim$}50 Myr to {$\sim$}4 Gyr. Because it relies on our physical model of convective penetration, this scenario has a limited number of assumptions. It can explain the observed trend between rotation and depletion, based on a single additional assumption, namely, that rotation affects the mixing efficiency at the convective boundary. We suggest the existence of a threshold in stellar rotation rate above which rotation strongly prevents the vertical penetration of plumes and below which rotation has small effects. In addition to providing a possible explanation for the long-standing problem of lithium depletion in pre-main-sequence and main-sequence stars, the strength of our scenario is that its basic assumptions can be tested by future hydrodynamic simulations.},

It is similar to the randomized, incremental algorithms for convex hull and delaunay triangulation. We provide empirical evidence that the algorithm runs faster when the input contains nonextreme points and that it used less memory. computational geometry algorithms have traditionally assumed that input sets are well behaved. When an algorithm is implemented with floating-point arithmetic, this assumption can lead to serous errors. We briefly describe a solution to this problem when computing the convex hull in two, three, or four dimensions. The output is a set of ``thick'' facets that contain all possible exact convex hulls of the input. A variation is effective in five or more dimensions.},

All techniques for inferring helium abundance from the observed frequencies of solar p modes are known to be sensitive to the equation of state used in the reference models. The sensitivity of inferred helium abundance to the equation of state is studied by using different reference models with MHD and OPAL equations of state. Recent observations of high-degree solar p-mode frequencies yield a helium abundance Y=0.246 when determined using reference models with the MHD equation of state and Y=0.249 using the OPAL equation of state. Further, the models constructed with the OPAL equation of state are found to be in better agreement with the inferred sound speed below the HeII ionization zone.},

We find that the oscillatory signal in the frequencies caused by the depression in {$\Gamma$}1 in the second helium ionization zone can be used to determine the envelope helium abundance of low-mass main-sequence stars. For frequency errors of one part in 104, we expect errors {$\sigma$}Y in the estimated helium abundance to range from 0.03 for 0.8-Msolar stars to 0.01 for 1.2-Msolar stars.

These characterizations are pivotal for endeavors such as searching for Earth-like planets and solar twins, understanding the mechanisms that govern stellar evolution, and tracing the dynamics of our Galaxy. The volume of data that is becoming available, however, brings with it the need to process this information accurately and rapidly. While existing methods can constrain fundamental stellar parameters such as ages, masses, and radii from these observations, they require substantial computational effort to do so. We develop a method based on machine learning for rapidly estimating fundamental parameters of main-sequence solar-like stars from classical and asteroseismic observations. We first demonstrate this method on a hare-and-hound exercise and then apply it to the Sun, 16 Cyg A and B, and 34 planet-hosting candidates that have been observed by the Kepler spacecraft. We find that our estimates and their associated uncertainties are comparable to the results of other methods, but with the additional benefit of being able to explore many more stellar parameters while using much less computation time. We furthermore use this method to present evidence for an empirical diffusion-mass relation. Our method is open source and freely available for the community to use.6},

We used the Stellar Parameters in an Instant (SPI) pipeline to estimate the parameters of nearly 100 stars observed by Kepler and Gaia, many of which are confirmed planet hosts. We adjusted the reported spectroscopic measurements of these stars by introducing faux systematic errors and, separately, artificially increasing the reported uncertainties of the measurements, and quantified the differences in the resulting parameters. Results. We find that a systematic error of 0.1 dex in [Fe/H] translates to differences of only 4\%, 2\%, and 1\% on average in the resulting stellar ages, masses, and radii, which are well within their uncertainties ({$\sim$}11\%, 3.5\%, 1.4\%) as derived by SPI. We also find that increasing the uncertainty of [Fe/H] measurements by 0.1 dex increases the uncertainties of the ages, masses, and radii by only 0.01 Gyr, 0.02 M , and 0.01 R , which are again well below their reported uncertainties ({$\sim$}0.5 Gyr, 0.04 M , 0.02 R ). The results for Teff at 100 K are similar. Conclusions. Stellar parameters from SPI are unchanged within uncertainties by errors of up to 0.14 dex or 175 K. They are even more robust to errors in Teff than the seismic scaling relations. Consequently, the parameters for their exoplanets are also robust.},

The full nine-year analysis of the time-ordered data provides updated characterizations and calibrations of the experiment. We also provide new nine-year full sky temperature maps that were processed to reduce the asymmetry of the effective beams. Temperature and polarization sky maps are examined to separate cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy from foreground emission, and both types of signals are analyzed in detail. We provide new point source catalogs as well as new diffuse and point source foreground masks. An updated template-removal process is used for cosmological analysis; new foreground fits are performed, and new foreground-reduced CMB maps are presented. We now implement an optimal C -1 weighting to compute the temperature angular power spectrum. The WMAP mission has resulted in a highly constrained {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmological model with precise and accurate parameters in agreement with a host of other cosmological measurements. When WMAP data are combined with finer scale CMB, baryon acoustic oscillation, and Hubble constant measurements, we find that big bang nucleosynthesis is well supported and there is no compelling evidence for a non-standard number of neutrino species (N eff = 3.84 {$\pm$} 0.40). The model fit also implies that the age of the universe is t 0 = 13.772 {$\pm$} 0.059 Gyr, and the fit Hubble constant is H 0 = 69.32 {$\pm$} 0.80 km s-1 Mpc-1. Inflation is also supported: the fluctuations are adiabatic, with Gaussian random phases; the detection of a deviation of the scalar spectral index from unity, reported earlier by the WMAP team, now has high statistical significance (ns = 0.9608 {$\pm$} 0.0080); and the universe is close to flat/Euclidean (\textbackslash Omega \_k = -0.0027\^\{+ 0.0039\}\_\{-0.0038\}). Overall, the WMAP mission has resulted in a reduction of the cosmological parameter volume by a factor of 68,000 for the standard six-parameter {$\Lambda$}CDM model, based on CMB data alone. For a model including tensors, the allowed seven-parameter volume has been reduced by a factor 117,000. Other cosmological observations are in accord with the CMB predictions, and the combined data reduces the cosmological parameter volume even further. With no significant anomalies and an adequate goodness of fit, the inflationary flat {$\Lambda$}CDM model and its precise and accurate parameters rooted in WMAP data stands as the standard model of cosmology.},

The median radius precision is {$\approx$}8\%, a typical improvement by a factor of 4\textendash 5 over previous estimates for typical Kepler stars. We find that {$\approx$}67\% ({$\approx$}120,000) of all Kepler targets are main-sequence stars, {$\approx$}21\% ({$\approx$}37,000) are subgiants, and {$\approx$}12\% ({$\approx$}21,000) are red giants, demonstrating that subgiant contamination is less severe than some previous estimates and that Kepler targets are mostly main-sequence stars. Using the revised stellar radii, we recalculate the radii for 2123 confirmed and 1922 candidate exoplanets. We confirm the presence of a gap in the radius distribution of small, close-in planets, but find that the gap is mostly limited to incident fluxes {$>$}200 F\AA, and its location may be at a slightly larger radius (closer to {$\approx$}2 R{$\oplus$}) when compared to previous results. Furthermore, we find several confirmed exoplanets occupying a previously described ``hot super-Earth desert'' at high irradiance, show the relation between a gas-giant planet's radius and its incident flux, and establish a bona fide sample of eight confirmed planets and 30 planet candidates with Rp {$<$} 2 R{$\oplus$} in circumstellar ``habitable zones'' (incident fluxes between 0.25 and 1.50 F\AA ).

  abstract = {We describe the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV (SDSS-IV), a project  encompassing three major spectroscopic programs. The Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment 2 (APOGEE-2) is observing hundreds of thousands of Milky Way stars at high resolution and high signal-to-noise ratios in the near-infrared. The Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) survey is obtaining spatially resolved spectroscopy for thousands of nearby galaxies (median z{$\sim$} 0.03). The extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) is mapping the galaxy, quasar, and neutral gas distributions between z{$\sim$} 0.6 and 3.5 to constrain cosmology using baryon acoustic oscillations, redshift space distortions, and the shape of the power spectrum. Within eBOSS, we are conducting two major subprograms: the SPectroscopic IDentification of eROSITA Sources (SPIDERS), investigating X-ray AGNs and galaxies in X-ray clusters, and the Time Domain Spectroscopic Survey (TDSS), obtaining spectra of variable sources. All programs use the 2.5 m Sloan Foundation Telescope at the Apache Point Observatory; observations there began in Summer 2014. APOGEE-2 also operates a second near-infrared spectrograph at the 2.5 m du Pont Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory, with observations beginning in early 2017. Observations at both facilities are scheduled to continue through 2020. In keeping with previous SDSS policy, SDSS-IV provides regularly scheduled public data releases; the first one, Data Release 13, was made available in 2016 July.},

  abstract = {Stellar models generally use simple parameterizations to treat  convection. The most widely used parameterization is the so-called mixing-length theory where the convective eddy sizes are described using a single number, {$\alpha$}, the mixing-length parameter. This is a free parameter, and the general practice is to calibrate {$\alpha$} using the known properties of the Sun and apply that to all stars. Using data from NASA's Kepler mission we show that using the solar-calibrated {$\alpha$} is not always appropriate, and that in many cases it would lead to estimates of initial helium abundances that are lower than the primordial helium abundance. Kepler data allow us to calibrate {$\alpha$} for many other stars and we show that for the sample of stars we have studied, the mixing-length parameter is generally lower than the solar value. We studied the correlation between {$\alpha$} and stellar properties, and we find that {$\alpha$} increases with metallicity. We therefore conclude that results obtained by fitting stellar models or by using population-synthesis models constructed with solar values of {$\alpha$} are likely to have large systematic errors. Our results also confirm theoretical expectations that the mixing-length parameter should vary with stellar properties.},

Our best-fit value is tseis = (4.57 +/- 0.11) ; Gyr which is in remarkably good agreement with the meteoritic value for the solar age.

  abstract = {Inferences about the spatial density or phase-space structure of stellar populations in the Milky Way require a precise determination of the effective survey volume. The volume observed by surveys such as Gaia or near-infrared spectroscopic surveys, which have good coverage of the Galactic midplane region, is highly complex because of the abundant small-scale structure in the three-dimensional interstellar dust extinction. We introduce a novel framework for analyzing the importance of small-scale structure in the extinction. This formalism demonstrates that the spatially complex effect of extinction on the selection function of a pencil-beam or contiguous sky survey is equivalent to a low-pass filtering of the extinction-affected selection function with the smooth density field. We find that the angular resolution of current 3D extinction maps is sufficient for analyzing Gaia sub-samples of millions of stars. However, the current distance resolution is inadequate and needs to be improved by an order of magnitude, especially in the inner Galaxy. We also present a practical and efficient method for properly taking the effect of extinction into account in analyses of Galactic structure through an effective selection function. We illustrate its use with the selection function of red-clump stars in APOGEE using and comparing a variety of current 3D extinction maps.},

  abstract = {The measured properties of stellar oscillations can provide powerful constraints on the internal structure and composition of stars. To begin this process, oscillation frequencies must be extracted from the observational data, typically time series of the star's brightness or radial velocity. In this paper, a probabilistic model is introduced for inferring the frequencies and amplitudes of stellar oscillation modes from data, assuming that there is some periodic character to the oscillations, but that they may not be exactly sinusoidal. Effectively, we fit damped oscillations to the time series, and hence the mode lifetime is also recovered. While this approach is computationally demanding for large time series (\&gt;1500 points), it should at least allow improved analysis of observations of solar-like oscillations in subgiant and red giant stars, as well as sparse observations of semiregular stars, where the number of points in the time series is often low. The method is demonstrated on simulated data and then applied to radial velocity measurements of the red giant star {$\xi$} Hydrae, yielding a mode lifetime between 0.41 and 2.65 d with 95 per cent posterior probability. The large frequency separation between modes is ambiguous, however we argue that the most plausible value is 6.3 {$\mu$}Hz, based on the radial velocity data and the star's position in the Hertzsprung\textendash Russell diagram.}

  abstract = {Context. Models of stellar structure and evolution can be constrained by  measuring accurate parameters of detached eclipsing binaries in open clusters. Multiple binary stars provide the means to determine helium abundances in these old stellar systems, and in turn, to improve age estimates. Aims: Earlier measurements of the masses and radii of the detached eclipsing binary V20 in the open cluster NGC 6791 were accurate enough to demonstrate that there are significant differences between current stellar models. Here we improve on those results and add measurements of two additional detached eclipsing binaries, the cluster members V18 and V80. The enlarged sample sets much tighter constraints on the properties of stellar models than has hitherto been possible, thereby improving both the accuracy and precision of the cluster age.  Methods: We employed (i) high-resolution UVES spectroscopy of V18, V20 and V80 to determine their spectroscopic effective temperatures, [Fe/H] values, and spectroscopic orbital elements; and (ii) time-series photometry from the Nordic Optical Telescope to obtain the photometric elements. Results: The masses and radii of the V18 and V20 components are found to high accuracy, with errors on the masses in the range 0.27-0.36\% and errors on the radii in the range 0.61-0.92\%. V80 is found to be magnetically active, and more observations are needed to determine its parameters accurately. The metallicity of NGC 6791 is measured from disentangled spectra of the binaries and a few single stars to be [Fe/H] = +0.29 {$\pm$} 0.03 (random) {$\pm$} 0.07 (systematic). The cluster reddening and apparent distance modulus are found to be E(B-V) = 0.160{$\pm$}0.025 and (m-M)V = 13.51 {$\pm$} 0.06. A first model comparison shows that we can constrain the helium content of the NGC 6791 stars, and thus reach a more accurate age than previously possible. It may be possible to constrain additional parameters, in particular the C, N, and O abundances. This will be investigated in Paper II. Conclusions: Using multiple, detached eclipsing binaries for determining stellar cluster ages, it is now possible to constrain parameters of stellar models, notably the helium content, which were previously out of reach. By observing a suitable number of detached eclipsing binaries in several open clusters, it will be possible to calibrate the age-scale and the helium enrichment parameter {$\Delta$}Y/{$\Delta$}Z, and provide firm constraints that stellar models must reproduce.

Multiple binary stars provide the means to determine helium abundances in these old stellar systems, and in turn, to improve estimates of their age. Aims: In the first paper of this series, we demonstrated how measurements of multiple eclipsing binaries in the old open cluster NGC 6791 sets tighter constraints on the properties of stellar models than has previously been possible, thereby potentially improving both the accuracy and precision of the cluster age. Here we add additional constraints and perform an extensive model comparison to determine the best estimates of the cluster age and helium content, employing as many observational constraints as possible. Methods: We improve our photometry and correct empirically for differential reddening effects. We then perform an extensive comparison of the new colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) and eclipsing binary measurements to Victoria and DSEP isochrones in order to estimate cluster parameters. We also reanalyse a spectrum of the star 2-17 to improve [Fe/H] constraints. Results: We find a best estimate of the age of \textasciitilde 8.3 Gyr for NGC 6791 while demonstrating that remaining age uncertainty is dominated by uncertainties in the CNO abundances. The helium mass fraction is well constrained at Y = 0.30{$\pm$}0.01 resulting in {$\Delta$}Y/{$\Delta$}Z \textasciitilde{} 1.4 assuming that such a relation exists. During the analysis we firmly identify blue straggler stars, including the star 2-17, and find indications for the presence of their evolved counterparts. Our analysis supports the RGB mass-loss found from asteroseismology and we determine precisely the absolute mass of stars on the lower RGB, MRGB = 1.15{$\pm$}0.02 M{$\odot$}. This will be an important consistency check for the detailed asteroseismology of cluster stars. Conclusions: Using multiple, detached eclipsing binaries for determining stellar cluster ages, it is now possible to constrain parameters of stellar models, notably the helium content, which were previously out of reach.

The large frequency separation is often one of the first outputs from asteroseismic studies because it can help constrain stellar properties like mass and radius. We have used three methods for estimating the large separations: use of individual p-mode frequencies, computation of the autocorrelation of frequency-power spectra, and computation of the power spectrum of the power spectrum. The values of the large separations obtained by the different methods are offset from each other and have differing sensitivities to the realization noise. A simple model was used to predict solar-cycle variations in the large separations, indicating that the variations are due to the well-known solar-cycle changes to mode frequency. However, this model is only valid over a restricted frequency range. We discuss the implications of these results for asteroseismology.},

  abstract = {Regions of rapid variation in the internal structure of a star are often  referred to as acoustic glitches since they create a characteristic periodic signature in the frequencies of p modes. Here we examine the localized disturbance arising from the helium second ionization zone in red giant branch and clump stars. More specifically, we determine how accurately and precisely the parameters of the ionization zone can be obtained from the oscillation frequencies of stellar models. We use models produced by three different generation codes that not only cover a wide range of stages of evolution along the red giant phase but also incorporate different initial helium abundances. To study the acoustic glitch caused by the second ionization zone of helium we have determined the second differences in frequencies of modes with the same angular degree, l, and then we fit the periodic function described by Houdek \& Gough to the second differences. We discuss the conditions under which such fits robustly and accurately determine the acoustic radius of the second ionization zone of helium. When the frequency of maximum amplitude of the p-mode oscillations was greater than 40 {$\mu$}Hz a robust value for the radius of the ionization zone was recovered for the majority of models. The determined radii of the ionization zones as inferred from the mode frequencies were found to be coincident with the local maximum in the first adiabatic exponent described by the models, which is associated with the outer edge of the second ionization zone of helium. Finally, we consider whether this method can be used to distinguish stars with different helium abundances. Although a definite trend in the amplitude of the signal is observed any distinction would be difficult unless the stars come from populations with vastly different helium abundances or the uncertainties associated with the fitted parameters can be reduced. However, application of our methodology could be useful for distinguishing between different populations of red giant stars in globular clusters, where distinct populations with very different helium abundances have been observed.},

  abstract = {Context. The 16Cyg binary system hosts the solar-like Kepler targets with the most stringent observational constraints. Indeed, we benefit from very high quality oscillation spectra, as well as spectroscopic and interferometric observations. Moreover, this system is particularly interesting since both stars are very similar in mass but the A component is orbited by a red dwarf, whereas the B component is orbited by a Jovian planet and thus could have formed a more complex planetary system. In our previous study, we showed that seismic inversions of integrated quantities could be used to constrain microscopic diffusion in the A component. In this study, we analyse the B component in the light of a more regularised inversion. Aims: We wish to analyse independently the B component of the 16Cyg binary system using the inversion of an indicator dedicated to analyse core conditions, denoted tu. Using this independent determination, we wish to analyse any differences between both stars due to the potential influence of planetary formation on stellar structure and/or their respective evolution. Methods: First, we recall the observational constraints for 16CygB and the method we used to generate reference stellar models of this star. We then describe how we improved the inversion and how this approach could be used for future targets with a sufficient number of observed frequencies. The inversion results were then used to analyse the differences between the A and B components. Results: The inversion of the tu indicator for 16CygB shows a disagreement with models including microscopic diffusion and sharing the chemical composition previously derived for 16CygA. We show that small changes in chemical composition are insufficient to solve the problem but that extra mixing can account for the differences seen between both stars. We use a parametric approach to analyse the impact of extra mixing in the form of turbulent diffusion on the behaviour of the tu values. We conclude on the necessity of further investigations using models with a physically motivated implementation of extra mixing processes including additional constraints to further improve the accuracy with which the fundamental parameters of this system are determined.},

We seek empirical constraints on {$\psi$} by measuring the stellar inclination Is via asteroseismology for an ensemble of 25 solar-type hosts observed with NASA's Kepler satellite. Our results for Is are consistent with alignment at the 2{$\sigma$} level for all stars in the sample, meaning that the system surrounding the red-giant star Kepler-56 remains as the only unambiguous misaligned multiple-planet system detected to date. The availability of a measurement of the projected spin-orbit angle {$\lambda$} for two of the systems allows us to estimate {$\psi$}. We find that the orbit of the hot Jupiter HAT-P-7b is likely to be retrograde (\textbackslash psi =116\textbackslash buildrel\{\textbackslash circ\}\textbackslash over\{.\} \{4\}-14.7+30.2), whereas that of Kepler-25c seems to be well aligned with the stellar spin axis (\textbackslash psi =12\textbackslash buildrel\{\textbackslash circ\}\textbackslash over\{.\} \{6\}-11.0+6.7). While the latter result is in apparent contradiction with a statement made previously in the literature that the multi-transiting system Kepler-25 is misaligned, we show that the results are consistent, given the large associated uncertainties. Finally, we perform a hierarchical Bayesian analysis based on the asteroseismic sample in order to recover the underlying distribution of {$\psi$}. The ensemble analysis suggests that the directions of the stellar spin and planetary orbital axes are correlated, as conveyed by a tendency of the host stars to display large values of inclination.},

Our sample of K dwarfs has homogeneously determined effective temperatures, bolometric luminosities and metallicities, allowing us to fit each star to the appropriate stellar isochrone and determine its helium content indirectly. We use a newly computed set of Padova isochrones which cover a wide range of helium and metal content. Our theoretical isochrones have been checked against a congruous set of main-sequence binaries with accurately measured masses, to discuss and validate their range of applicability. We find that the stellar masses deduced from the isochrones are usually in excellent agreement with empirical measurements. Good agreement is also found with empirical mass-luminosity relations. Despite fitting the masses of the stars very well, we find that anomalously low helium content (lower than primordial helium) is required to fit the luminosities and temperatures of the metal-poor K dwarfs, while more conventional values of the helium content are derived for the stars around solar metallicity. We have investigated the effect of diffusion in stellar models and the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) in deriving metallicities. Neither of these is able to resolve the low-helium problem alone and only marginally if the cumulated effects are included, unless we assume a mixing-length which is strongly decreasing with metallicity. Further work in stellar models is urgently needed. The helium-to-metal enrichment ratio is found to be {$\Delta$}Y/{$\Delta$}Z = 2.1 +/- 0.9 around and above solar metallicity, consistent with previous studies, whereas open problems still remain at the lowest metallicities. Finally, we determine the helium content for a set of planetary host stars.},

Despite much work and the high internal precision usually achieved, systematic differences of order 100 K (or more) among various scales are still present. We present an investigation based on the infrared flux method aimed at assessing the source of such discrepancies and pin down their origin. We break the impasse among different scales by using a large set of solar twins, stars which are spectroscopically and photometrically identical to the Sun, to set the absolute zero point of the effective temperature scale to within few degrees. Our newly calibrated, accurate and precise temperature scale applies to dwarfs and subgiants, from super-solar metallicities to the most metal-poor stars currently known. At solar metallicities our results validate spectroscopic effective temperature scales, whereas for [Fe/H]{$\lnapprox$} -2.5 our temperatures are roughly 100 K hotter than those determined from model fits to the Balmer lines and 200 K hotter than those obtained from the excitation equilibrium of Fe lines. Empirical bolometric corrections and useful relations linking photometric indices to effective temperatures and angular diameters have been derived. Our results take full advantage of the high accuracy reached in absolute calibration in recent years and are further validated by interferometric angular diameters and space based spectrophotometry over a wide range of effective temperatures and metallicities.

In order to use Gaia parallaxes to infer distances to high precision, we develop a hierarchical probabilistic model to determine the Gaia parallax zero-point offset along with the calibration of an empirical model for luminosity of red clump stars by combining astrometric and photometric measurements. Using a cross-matched sample of red clump stars from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment and Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2), we report the parallax zero-point offset in DR2 to be {$\pi\_$}0 = -48 {$\pm$} 1 {$\mu$} as. We infer the red clump absolute magnitude to be -1.622 {$\pm$} 0.004 in Ks, 0.435 {$\pm$} 0.004 in G, -1.019 {$\pm$} 0.004 in J, and -1.516 {$\pm$} 0.004 in H. The intrinsic scatter of the red clump is {$\sim$}0.09 mag in J, H, and Ks, or {$\sim$} 0.12 mag in G. We tailor our models to accommodate more complex analyses such as investigating the variations of the parallax zero-point with each source's observed magnitude, observed colour, and sky position. In particular, we find fluctuations of the zero-point across the sky to be of order or less than a few 10s of {$\mu$} as.},

Estimates of the mean frequency shifts of low-degree p-modes have been extracted over a period spanning solar cycles 21-23. Two methods of analysis are used to extract the frequency shifts: one method uses results on fitted frequencies of individual modes, which are then averaged to give mean frequency shifts; the other method uses cross-correlations of power frequency spectra made from subsets of the data shifted in time. The frequency shifts are correlated against six proxies of solar activity, which are sensitive to magnetic and irradiance variability at a range of locations from the photosphere to the corona. We find proxies that have good sensitivity to the effects of weak-component magnetic flux-which is more widely distributed in latitude than the strong flux in the active regions-are those that follow the frequency shifts most consistently over the three cycles. This list includes the Mg II H and K core-to-wing data, the 10.7 cm radio flux, and the He I equivalent width data. While the two methods of analysis give consistent results, use of the cross-correlation function to measure mean frequency shifts returns less precise values in cases in which the duty cycle is greater than 30\%. Estimation of uncertainties from the cross-correlation method also requires that proper allowance be made for strong correlations in the data.},

Although these accreted stellar populations can be forensically identified as kinematically distinct structures within the Galaxy, it is difficult in general to date precisely the age at which any one merger occurred. Recent results have revealed a population of stars that were accreted via the collision of a dwarf galaxy, called Gaia-Enceladus1, leading to substantial pollution of the chemical and dynamical properties of the Milky Way. Here we identify the very bright, naked-eye star {$\nu$} Indi as an indicator of the age of the early in situ population of the Galaxy. We combine asteroseismic, spectroscopic, astrometric and kinematic observations to show that this metal-poor, alpha-element-rich star was an indigenous member of the halo, and we measure its age to be 11.0 {$\pm$}0.7 ? (stat) {$\pm$}0.8 ? (sys) billion years. The star bears hallmarks consistent with having been kinematically heated by the Gaia-Enceladus collision. Its age implies that the earliest the merger could have begun was 11.6 and 13.2 billion years ago, at 68\% and 95\% confidence, respectively. Computations based on hierarchical cosmological models slightly reduce the above limits.}

  abstract = {We report the discovery of a group of apparently young CoRoT red-giant stars exhibiting enhanced [{$\alpha$}/Fe] abundance ratios (as determined from APOGEE spectra) with respect to solar values. Their existence is not explained by standard chemical evolution models of the Milky Way, and shows that the chemical-enrichment history of the Galactic disc is more complex. We find similar stars in previously published samples for which isochrone-ages could be reliably obtained, although in smaller relative numbers. This might explain why these stars have not previously received attention. The young [{$\alpha$}/Fe]-rich stars are much more numerous in the CoRoT-APOGEE (CoRoGEE) inner-field sample than in any other high-resolution sample available at present because only CoRoGEE can explore the inner-disc regions and provide ages for its field stars. The kinematic properties of the young [{$\alpha$}/Fe]-rich stars are not clearly thick-disc like, despite their rather large distances from the Galactic mid-plane. Our tentative interpretation of these and previous intriguing observations in the Milky Way is that these stars were formed close to the end of the Galactic bar, near corotation \textendash{} a region where gas can be kept inert for longer times than in other regions that are more frequently shocked by the passage of spiral arms. Moreover, this is where the mass return from older inner-disc stellar generations is expected to be highest (according to an inside-out disc-formation scenario), which additionally dilutes the in-situ gas. Other possibilities to explain these observations (e.g., a recent gas-accretion event) are also discussed.},

It is found that a Saltpeter-like mass function cannot be safely used to reproduce the observed Delta Y/Delta Z ratios unless massive star mass loss at substantial rates is invoked, since this function equally weighs both helium and metal producers.

  abstract = {This is the first of a series of papers presenting the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) Isochrones and Stellar Tracks (MIST) project, a new comprehensive set of stellar evolutionary tracks and isochrones computed using MESA, a state-of-the-art open-source 1D stellar evolution package. In this work, we present models with solar-scaled abundance ratios covering a wide range of ages (5{$\leq$}slant \{log\}(\{Age\}) [\{year\}]{$\leq$}slant 10.3), masses (0.1{$\leq$}slant M/\{M\}{$\odot$} {$\leq$}slant 300), and metallicities (-2.0{$\leq$}slant [\{\{Z\}\}/\{\{H\}\}]{$\leq$}slant 0.5). The models are self-consistently and continuously evolved from the pre-main sequence (PMS) to the end of hydrogen burning, the white dwarf cooling sequence, or the end of carbon burning, depending on the initial mass. We also provide a grid of models evolved from the PMS to the end of core helium burning for -4.0{$\leq$}slant [\{\{Z\}\}/\{\{H\}\}]\textbackslash lt -2.0. We showcase extensive comparisons with observational constraints as well as with some of the most widely used existing models in the literature.

  abstract = {By using the periodic signal present in the frequencies of oscillation due to the base of the solar convection zone, Monteiro, Christensen-Dalsgaard \& Thompson gave an upper limit to the extent of a layer of convective overshooting in the Sun. Alternative studies have suggested that it may not be possible to do so since the amplitude of the signal does not vary monotonically with the extent of the layer. In this work a new more complete set of models is used to compare the values of the amplitude obtained from the fitting of the signal with the expected amplitudes. These are determined using the assumption that the rapid variation occurring at the base of the convection zone and creating the periodic signal can be described as discontinuities of the sound-speed derivatives. The amplitude of the signal due to the discontinuity of the third derivative of the sound speed is then proportional to the derivative of the radiative gradient, while the amplitude resulting from the discontinuity of the second derivative is proportional to the difference between radiative and adiabatic gradients at the position where the transition occurs. The latter is non-zero only if overshoot is present. Asymptotic predictions of the amplitudes of the signal in the p-mode frequencies are in good agreement with the values found from fitting models with substantial overshoot regions; as was also found by Monteiro et al., the observed solar frequencies place severe limits on the extent of overshoot of this nature.},

  abstract = {We introduce the "exponential linear unit" (ELU) which speeds up learning in deep neural networks and leads to higher classification accuracies. Like rectified linear units (ReLUs), leaky ReLUs (LReLUs) and parametrized ReLUs (PReLUs), ELUs alleviate the vanishing gradient problem via the identity for positive values. However, ELUs have improved learning characteristics compared to the units with other activation functions. In contrast to ReLUs, ELUs have negative values which allows them to push mean unit activations closer to zero like batch normalization but with lower computational complexity. Mean shifts toward zero speed up learning by bringing the normal gradient closer to the unit natural gradient because of a reduced bias shift effect. While LReLUs and PReLUs have negative values, too, they do not ensure a noise-robust deactivation state. ELUs saturate to a negative value with smaller inputs and thereby decrease the forward propagated variation and information. Therefore, ELUs code the degree of presence of particular phenomena in the input, while they do not quantitatively model the degree of their absence. In experiments, ELUs lead not only to faster learning, but also to significantly better generalization performance than ReLUs and LReLUs on networks with more than 5 layers. On CIFAR-100 ELUs networks significantly outperform ReLU networks with batch normalization while batch normalization does not improve ELU networks. ELU networks are among the top 10 reported CIFAR-10 results and yield the best published result on CIFAR-100, without resorting to multi-view evaluation or model averaging. On ImageNet, ELU networks considerably speed up learning compared to a ReLU network with the same architecture, obtaining less than 10\% classification error for a single crop, single model network.},

CAIs define a brief formation interval corresponding to an age of 4567.30 {$\pm$} 0.16 million years (My), whereas chondrule ages range from 4567.32 {$\pm$} 0.42 to 4564.71 {$\pm$} 0.30 My.

The amount of helium that was made during Big Bang nucleosynthesis is determined by combining particle physics and cosmology3. The current leading measures of the primordial helium abundance (YP) are based on the relative strengths of H uc(i) and He uc(i) emission lines emanating from star-forming regions in local metal-poor galaxies4-7. As the statistical errors on these measurements improve, it is essential to test for systematics by developing independent techniques. Here we report a determination of the primordial helium abundance based on a near-pristine intergalactic gas cloud that is seen in absorption against the light of a background quasar. This gas cloud, observed when the Universe was just one-third of its present age (zabs = 1.724), has a metal content around 100 times less than that of the Sun, and at least 30\% less metal content than the most metal-poor H uc(ii) region currently known where a determination of the primordial helium abundance is possible. We conclude that the helium abundance of this intergalactic gas cloud is Y =0.25 0-0.025+0.033 , which agrees with the standard model primordial value8-10, YP = 0.24672 {$\pm$} 0.00017. Our determination of the primordial helium abundance is not yet as precise as that derived using metal-poor galaxies, but our method has the potential to offer a competitive test of physics beyond the standard model during Big Bang nucleosynthesis.}

A brief overview of the essentials of this physics is given, and new calculations presented of light-element abundances through 6Li and 7Li, with updated nuclear reactions and uncertainties including those in the neutron lifetime. Fits are provided for these results as a function of baryon density and of the number of neutrino flavors N{$\nu$}. Recent developments are reviewed in BBN, particularly new, precision Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements that now probe the baryon density, helium content, and the effective number of degrees of freedom Neff. These measurements allow for a tight test of BBN and cosmology using CMB data alone. Our likelihood analysis convolves the 2015 Planck data chains with our BBN output and observational data. Adding astronomical measurements of light elements strengthens the power of BBN. A new determination of the primordial helium abundance is included in our likelihood analysis. New D/H observations are now more precise than the corresponding theoretical predictions and are consistent with the standard model and the Planck baryon density. Moreover, D/H now provides a tight measurement of N{$\nu$} when combined with the CMB baryon density and provides a 2 {$\sigma$} upper limit N{$\nu<$}3.2 . The new precision of the CMB and D/H observations together leaves D/H predictions as the largest source of uncertainties. Future improvement in BBN calculations will therefore rely on improved nuclear cross-section data. In contrast with D/H and 4He, 7Li predictions continue to disagree with observations, perhaps pointing to new physics. This paper concludes with a look at future directions including key nuclear reactions, astronomical observations, and theoretical issues.}

The core of the approach is a Bayesian artificial neural network (ANN) that learns from and completely replaces stellar isochrones. The ANN is trained using a sample of red giant stars with mass estimates from asteroseismology. A Bayesian isochrone pipeline uses the astrometric, photometric, spectroscopic, and asteroseismology data to determine posterior distributions for the training outputs: mass, age, and distance. Given new inputs, posterior predictive distributions for the outputs are computed, taking into account both input uncertainties, and uncertainties in the ANN parameters. We apply MADE to 10 000 red giants in the overlap between the 14th data release from the APO Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) and the Tycho-Gaia astrometric solution (TGAS). The ANN is able to reduce the uncertainty on mass, age, and distance estimates for training-set stars with high output uncertainties allocated through the Bayesian isochrone pipeline. The fractional uncertainties on mass are \&lt; 10 per cent and on age are between 10 to 25 per cent. Moreover, the time taken for our ANN to predict masses, ages, and distances for the entire catalogue of APOGEE-TGAS stars is of a similar order of the time taken by the Bayesian isochrone pipeline to run on a handful of stars. Our resulting catalogue clearly demonstrates the expected thick- and thin-disc components in the [M/H]-[{$\alpha$}/M] plane, when examined by age.},

  abstract = {Photoelectric observations of solar p-modes obtained with improved wavenumber and frequency resolution are presented. The observations are compared with model calculations of the p-modes, and the degree of spatial and temporal coherence of the observed wave pattern is investigated. It is found that the p-mode oscillations pervade the visible surface of the sun with a high degree of coherence in space and time, so that the whole complex pattern of standing waves with its nodes and antinodes can be regarded as a fixed pattern corotating with the solar surface layers. The p-modes are introduced as a tracer of solar rotational flow velocities. The equatorial differential rotation is estimated as a function of effective depth on the basis of the theoretical contribution functions for the p-modes recently derived by Ulrich et al. (1978). The results strongly indicate that the angular speed of rotation is not uniform even in the relatively shallow layer extending about 20,000 km below the photosphere.},

  abstract = {The TensorFlow Distributions library implements a vision of probability theory adapted to the modern deep-learning paradigm of end-to-end differentiable computation. Building on two basic abstractions, it offers flexible building blocks for probabilistic computation. Distributions provide fast, numerically stable methods for generating samples and computing statistics, e.g., log density. Bijectors provide composable volume-tracking transformations with automatic caching. Together these enable modular construction of high dimensional distributions and transformations not possible with previous libraries (e.g., pixelCNNs, autoregressive flows, and reversible residual networks). They are the workhorse behind deep probabilistic programming systems like Edward and empower fast black-box inference in probabilistic models built on deep-network components. TensorFlow Distributions has proven an important part of the TensorFlow toolkit within Google and in the broader deep learning community.},

  abstract = {We study the dynamics of the stellar interior of the early red-giant star KIC 4448777 by asteroseismic inversion of 14 splittings of the dipole mixed modes obtained from Kepler observations. In order to overcome the complexity of the oscillation pattern typical of red-giant stars, we present a procedure to extract the rotational splittings from the power spectrum. We find not only that the core rotates from a minimum of 8 to a maximum of 17 times faster than the surface, confirming previous inversion results generated for other red giants (Deheuvels et al.), but we also estimate the variation of the angular velocity within the helium core with a spatial resolution of 0.001R and verify the hypothesis of a sharp discontinuity in the inner stellar rotation. The results show that the entire core rotates rigidly and provide evidence for an angular velocity gradient around the base of the hydrogen-burning shell; however, we do not succeed in characterizing the rotational slope, due to the intrinsic limits of the applied techniques. The angular velocity, from the edge of the core, appears to decrease with increasing distance from the center, reaching an average value in the convective envelope of 68 {$\pm$} 22 nHz. We conclude that a set of data that includes only dipolar modes is sufficient to infer quite accurately the rotation of a red giant not only in the dense core but also, with a lower level of confidence, in part of the radiative region and in the convective envelope.},

  abstract = {In the era of large stellar spectroscopic surveys, there is an emphasis on deriving not only stellar abundances but also the ages for millions of stars. In the context of Galactic archeology, stellar ages provide a direct probe of the formation history of the Galaxy. We use the stellar evolution code MESA to compute models with atomic diffusion\textemdash with and without radiative acceleration\textemdash and extra mixing in the surface layers. The extra mixing consists of both density-dependent turbulent mixing and envelope overshoot mixing. Based on these models we argue that it is important to distinguish between initial, bulk abundances (parameters) and current, surface abundances (variables) in the analysis of individual stellar ages. In stars that maintain radiative regions on evolutionary timescales, atomic diffusion modifies the surface abundances. We show that when initial, bulk metallicity is equated with current, surface metallicity in isochrone age analysis, the resulting stellar ages can be systematically overestimated by up to 20\%. The change of surface abundances with evolutionary phase also complicates chemical tagging, which is the concept that dispersed star clusters can be identified through unique, high-dimensional chemical signatures. Stars from the same cluster, but in different evolutionary phases, will show different surface abundances. We speculate that calibration of stellar models may allow us to estimate not only stellar ages but also initial abundances for individual stars. In the meantime, analyzing the chemical properties of stars in similar evolutionary phases is essential to minimize the effects of atomic diffusion in the context of chemical tagging.},

When well populated with precise measurements, they allow quick inferences to be made about the bulk properties of an astronomic object simply from its proximity on a diagram to other objects. We present here a PYTHON toolkit that allows a user to produce colour-magnitude diagrams of transiting exoplanets, comparing planets to populations of ultra-cool dwarfs, of directly imaged exoplanets, to theoretical models of planetary atmospheres, and to other transiting exoplanets. Using a selection of near- and mid-infrared colour-magnitude diagrams, we show how outliers can be identified for further investigation, and how emerging subpopulations can be identified. Additionally, we present evidence that observed differences in the Spitzer's 4.5 {$\mu$}m flux, between irradiated Jupiters and field brown dwarfs, might be attributed to phosphine, which is susceptible to photolysis. The presence of phosphine in low-irradiation environments may negate the need for thermal inversions to explain eclipse measurements. We speculate that the anomalously low 4.5 {$\mu$}m flux of the nightside of HD-=189733b and the daysides of GJ-=436b and GJ-=3470b might be caused by phosphine absorption. Finally, we use our toolkit to include Hubble Wide Field Camera 3 spectra, creating a new photometric band called the 'Water band' (WJH band) in the process. We show that the colour index [WJH - H] can be used to constrain the C/O ratio of exoplanets, showing that future observations with James Webb Space Telescope and Ariel will be able to distinguish these populations if they exist, and select members for future follow-up.},

  abstract = {This paper focuses on cosmological constraints derived from analysis of  WMAP data alone. A simple {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmological model fits the five-year WMAP temperature and polarization data. The basic parameters of the model are consistent with the three-year data and now better constrained: {$\Omega$} b h 2 = 0.02273 {$\pm$} 0.00062, {$\Omega$} c h 2 = 0.1099 {$\pm$} 0.0062, {$\Omega\Lambda$} = 0.742 {$\pm$} 0.030, ns = 0.963+0.014 -0.015, {$\tau$} = 0.087 {$\pm$} 0.017, and {$\sigma$}8 = 0.796 {$\pm$} 0.036, with h = 0.719+0.026 -0.027. With five years of polarization data, we have measured the optical depth to reionization, {$\tau>$}0, at 5{$\sigma$} significance. The redshift of an instantaneous reionization is constrained to be z reion = 11.0 {$\pm$} 1.4 with 68\% confidence. The 2{$\sigma$} lower limit is z reion {$>$} 8.2, and the 3{$\sigma$} limit is z reion {$>$} 6.7. This excludes a sudden reionization of the universe at z = 6 at more than 3.5{$\sigma$} significance, suggesting that reionization was an extended process. Using two methods for polarized foreground cleaning we get consistent estimates for the optical depth, indicating an error due to the foreground treatment of {$\tau$} \textasciitilde{} 0.01. This cosmological model also fits small-scale cosmic microwave background (CMB) data, and a range of astronomical data measuring the expansion rate and clustering of matter in the universe. We find evidence for the first time in the CMB power spectrum for a nonzero cosmic neutrino background, or a background of relativistic species, with the standard three light neutrino species preferred over the best-fit {$\Lambda$}CDM model with N eff = 0 at {$>$}99.5\% confidence, and N eff {$>$} 2.3(95\%confidence limit (CL)) when varied. The five-year WMAP data improve the upper limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, r {$<$} 0.43(95\%CL), for power-law models, and halve the limit on r for models with a running index, r {$<$} 0.58(95\%CL). With longer integration we find no evidence for a running spectral index, with dns /dln k = -0.037 {$\pm$} 0.028, and find improved limits on isocurvature fluctuations. The current WMAP-only limit on the sum of the neutrino masses is {$\sum$}m {$\nu$} {$<$} 1.3 eV(95\%CL), which is robust, to within 10\%, to a varying tensor amplitude, running spectral index, or dark energy equation of state.

This is essential to improve the quality of the results obtained from asteroseismology as it will provide better stellar models which in turn can be used to refine inferences made in exoplanetology and galactic archaeology. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Methods: The presented method - WhoSGlAd - relies on Gram-Schmidt's orthogonalisation process. A Euclidean vector sub-space of functions is defined and the oscillation frequencies are projected over an orthonormal basis in a specific order. This allowed us to obtain independent coefficients that we combined to define independent seismic indicators. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Results: The developed method has been shown to be stable and to converge efficiently for solar-like pulsators. Thus, detailed and precise inferences can be obtained on the mass, the age, the chemical composition and the undershooting in the interior of the studied stars. However, attention has to be paid when studying the helium glitch as there seems to be a degeneracy between the influence of the helium abundance and that of the heavy elements on the glitch amplitude. As an example, we analyse the 16CygA (HD 186408) oscillation spectrum to provide an illustration of the capabilities of the method.},

The search for optimal models was carried out through a Levenberg-Marquardt minimisation. First, we found individual optimal models for both stars. We then selected the best candidates to fit both stars while imposing a common age and composition. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Results: We computed realistic ranges of stellar parameters for individual stars. We also provide two models of the system regarded as a whole.

The new computations include a more complete equation of state (EOS) with more grain species and updated optical constants. Grains are now explicitly included in thermal equilibrium in the EOS calculation, which allows for a much wider range of grain compositions to be accurately included than was previously the case. The inclusion of high-temperature condensates such as Al2O3 and CaTiO3 significantly affects the total opacity over a narrow range of temperatures before the appearance of the first silicate grains. The new opacity tables are tabulated for temperatures ranging from 30,000 to 500 K with gas densities from 10-4 to 10-19 g cm-3. Comparisons with previous Rosseland mean opacity calculations are discussed. At high temperatures, the agreement with OPAL and Opacity Project is quite good. Comparisons at lower temperatures are more divergent as a result of differences in molecular and grain physics included in different calculations. The computation of Planck mean opacities performed with the opacity sampling method is shown to require a very large number of opacity sampling wavelength points; previously published results obtained with fewer wavelength points are shown to be significantly in error.

The high-resolution (R {$\sim$} 22,500), near infrared (1.51-1.7 {$\mu$}m) APOGEE spectra provide measurements of stellar atmospheric parameters (temperature, surface gravity, [M/H], and [{$\alpha$}/M]). Due to the smaller uncertainties in surface gravity possible with high-resolution spectra and accurate Hipparcos distance measurements, we are able to calculate the stellar masses to within 30\%. For giants, the relatively rapid evolution up the red giant branch allows the age to be constrained by the mass. We examine methods of estimating age using both the mass-age relation directly and a Bayesian isochrone matching of measured parameters, assuming a constant SFH. To improve the SFH prior, we use a hierarchical modeling approach to constrain the parameters of the model SFH using the age probability distribution functions of the data. The results of an {$\alpha$}-dependent Gaussian SFH model show a clear age-[{$\alpha$}/M] relation at all ages. Using this SFH model as the prior for an empirical Bayesian analysis, we determine ages for individual stars. The resulting age-metallicity relation is flat, with a slight decrease in [M/H] at the oldest ages and a {$\sim$}0.5 dex spread in metallicity across most ages. For stars with ages {$\lessequivlnt$}1 Gyr we find a smaller spread, consistent with radial migration having a smaller effect on these young stars than on the older stars.},

We know that radial orbit migration is strong in the Galactic low-{$\alpha$} disk and set out to quantify the relative importance of these two effects, by devising and applying a parameterized model ( \$\{\{\textbackslash boldsymbol\{p\}\}\}\_\{\{\textbackslash boldsymbol\{m\}\}\}\$ ) for the distribution \$p(\{L\}\_\{z\},\{J\}\_\{R\},\textbackslash tau ,\textbackslash left[\textbackslash mathrm\{Fe\}/\{\textbackslash rm\{H\}\}\textbackslash right]| \{\{\textbackslash boldsymbol\{p\}\}\}\_\{\{\textbackslash boldsymbol\{m\}\}\})\$ in the stellar disk. This model describes the orbit evolution for stars of age {$\tau$} and metallicity \$\textbackslash left[\textbackslash mathrm\{Fe\}/\{\textbackslash rm\{H\}\}\textbackslash right]\$ , presuming that coeval stars were initially born on (near-)circular orbits, and with a unique \$\textbackslash left[\textbackslash mathrm\{Fe\}/\{\textbackslash rm\{H\}\}\textbackslash right]\$ at a given birth angular momentum and age. We fit this model to APOGEE red clump stars, accounting for the complex selection function of the survey. The best-fit model implies changes of angular momentum of \$\textbackslash sqrt\{\textbackslash langle \{\textbackslash rm\{\textbackslash Delta \}\}\{L\}\_\{z\}\{\textbackslash rangle \}\^\{2\}\}\textbackslash approx 619\textbackslash,\textbackslash mathrm\{kpc\}\textbackslash,\textbackslash mathrm\{km\}\textbackslash,\{\{\textbackslash rm\{s\}\}\}\^\{-1\}\textbackslash{} \{(\textbackslash tau /6\textbackslash mathrm\{Gyr\})\}\^\{0.5\}\$ and changes of radial action as \$\textbackslash sqrt\{\textbackslash langle \{\textbackslash rm\{\textbackslash Delta \}\}\{J\}\_\{R\}\{\textbackslash rangle \}\^\{2\}\}\textbackslash approx 63\textbackslash,\textbackslash mathrm\{kpc\}\textbackslash,\textbackslash mathrm\{km\}\textbackslash,\{\{\textbackslash rm\{s\}\}\}\^\{-1\}\{(\textbackslash tau /6\textbackslash mathrm\{Gyr\})\}\^\{0.6\}\$ at 8 kpc.

  abstract = {The abundance patterns of the most metal-poor stars in the Galactic halo and small dwarf galaxies provide us with a wealth of information about the early Universe. In particular, these old survivors allow us to study the nature of the first stars and supernovae, the relevant nucleosynthesis processes responsible for the formation and evolution of the elements, early star- and galaxy formation processes, as well as the assembly process of the stellar halo from dwarf galaxies a long time ago. This review presents the current state of the field of ``stellar archaeology'' - the diverse use of metal-poor stars to explore the high-redshift Universe and its constituents. In particular, the conditions for early star formation are discussed, how these ultimately led to a chemical evolution, and what the role of the most iron-poor stars is for learning about Population III supernovae yields. Rapid neutron-capture signatures found in metal-poor stars can be used to obtain stellar ages, but also to constrain this complex nucleosynthesis process with observational measurements. Moreover, chemical abundances of extremely metal-poor stars in different types of dwarf galaxies can be used to infer details on the formation scenario of the halo and the role of dwarf galaxies as Galactic building blocks. I conclude with an outlook as to where this field may be heading within the next decade. A table of {$\sim$} 1000 metal-poor stars and their abundances as collected from the literature is provided in electronic format.},

  abstract = {Electromagnetic radiation from the Sun is Earth's primary energy source. Space-based radiometric measurements in the past two decades have begun to establish the nature, magnitude and origins of its variability. An 11-year cycle with peak-to-peak amplitude of order 0.1 \% is now well established in recent total solar irradiance observations, as are larger variations of order 0.2 \% associated with the Sun's 27-day rotation period. The ultraviolet, visible and infrared spectral regions all participate in these variations, with larger changes at shorter wavelengths. Linkages of solar radiative output variations with solar magnetism are clearly identified. Active regions alter the local radiance, and their wavelength-dependent contrasts relative to the quiet Sun control the relative spectrum of irradiance variability. Solar radiative output also responds to sub-surface convection and to eruptive events on the Sun. On the shortest time scales, total irradiance exhibits five minute fluctuations of amplitude {$\approx$} 0.003 \%, and can increase to as much as 0.015 \% during the very largest solar flares. Unknown is whether multi-decadal changes in solar activity produce longer-term irradiance variations larger than observed thus far in the contemporary epoch. Empirical associations with solar activity proxies suggest reduced total solar irradiance during the anomalously low activity in the seventeenth century Maunder Minimum relative to the present. Uncertainties in understanding the physical relationships between direct magnetic modulation of solar radiative output and heliospheric modulation of cosmogenic proxies preclude definitive historical irradiance estimates, as yet.},

  abstract = {Context. We present the second Gaia data release, Gaia DR2, consisting of astrometry, photometry, radial velocities, and information on astrophysical parameters and variability, for sources brighter than magnitude 21. In addition epoch astrometry and photometry are provided for a modest sample of minor planets in the solar system. Aims: A summary of the contents of Gaia DR2 is presented, accompanied by a discussion on the differences with respect to Gaia DR1 and an overview of the main limitations which are still present in the survey. Recommendations are made on the responsible use of Gaia DR2 results. Methods: The raw data collected with the Gaia instruments during the first 22 months of the mission have been processed by the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) and turned into this second data release, which represents a major advance with respect to Gaia DR1 in terms of completeness, performance, and richness of the data products. Results: Gaia DR2 contains celestial positions and the apparent brightness in G for approximately 1.7 billion sources. For 1.3 billion of those sources, parallaxes and proper motions are in addition available. The sample of sources for which variability information is provided is expanded to 0.5 million stars. This data release contains four new elements: broad-band colour information in the form of the apparent brightness in the GBP (330-680 nm) and GRP (630-1050 nm) bands is available for 1.4 billion sources; median radial velocities for some 7 million sources are presented; for between 77 and 161 million sources estimates are provided of the stellar effective temperature, extinction, reddening, and radius and luminosity; and for a pre-selected list of 14 000 minor planets in the solar system epoch astrometry and photometry are presented. Finally, Gaia DR2 also represents a new materialisation of the celestial reference frame in the optical, the Gaia-CRF2, which is the first optical reference frame based solely on extragalactic sources. There are notable changes in the photometric system and the catalogue source list with respect to Gaia DR1, and we stress the need to consider the two data releases as independent. Conclusions: Gaia DR2 represents a major achievement for the Gaia mission, delivering on the long standing promise to provide parallaxes and proper motions for over 1 billion stars, and representing a first step in the availability of complementary radial velocity and source astrophysical information for a sample of stars in the Gaia survey which covers a very substantial fraction of the volume of our galaxy.},

  abstract = {Gaia is a cornerstone mission in the science programme of the EuropeanSpace Agency (ESA). The spacecraft construction was approved in 2006, following a study in which the original interferometric concept was changed to a direct-imaging approach. Both the spacecraft and the payload were built by European industry. The involvement of the scientific community focusses on data processing for which the international Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) was selected in 2007. Gaia was launched on 19 December 2013 and arrived at its operating point, the second Lagrange point of the Sun-Earth-Moon system, a few weeks later. The commissioning of the spacecraft and payload was completed on 19 July 2014. The nominal five-year mission started with four weeks of special, ecliptic-pole scanning and subsequently transferred into full-sky scanning mode. We recall the scientific goals of Gaia and give a description of the as-built spacecraft that is currently (mid-2016) being operated to achieve these goals. We pay special attention to the payload module, the performance of which is closely related to the scientific performance of the mission. We provide a summary of the commissioning activities and findings, followed by a description of the routine operational mode. We summarise scientific performance estimates on the basis of in-orbit operations. Several intermediate Gaia data releases are planned and the data can be retrieved from the Gaia Archive, which is available through the Gaia home page. http://www.cosmos.esa.int/gaia},

  abstract = {Until the last few decades, investigations of stellar interiors had been restricted to theoretical studies only constrained by observations of their global properties and external characteristics. However, in the last 30 years the field has been revolutionized by the ability to perform seismic investigations of stellar interiors. This revolution begun with the Sun, where helioseismology has been yielding information competing with what can be inferred about the Earth's interior from geoseismology. The last two decades have witnessed the advent of asteroseismology of solar-like stars, thanks to a dramatic development of new observing facilities providing the first reliable results on the interiors of distant stars. The coming years will see a huge development in this field. In this review we focus on solar-type stars, i.e., cool main-sequence stars where oscillations are stochastically excited by surface convection. After a short introduction and a historical overview of the discipline, we review the observational techniques generally used, and we describe the theory behind stellar oscillations in cool main-sequence stars. We continue with a complete description of the normal mode analyses through which it is possible to extract the physical information about the structure and dynamics of the stars. We then summarize the lessons that we have learned and discuss unsolved issues and questions that are still unanswered.},

The APOGEE Stellar Parameter and Chemical Abundances Pipeline (ASPCAP) is the software developed for the automated analysis of these spectra. ASPCAP determines atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances from observed spectra by comparing observed spectra to libraries of theoretical spectra, using {$\chi$}2 minimization in a multidimensional parameter space. The package consists of a fortran90 code that does the actual minimization and a wrapper IDL code for book-keeping and data handling. This paper explains in detail the ASPCAP components and functionality, and presents results from a number of tests designed to check its performance. ASPCAP provides stellar effective temperatures, surface gravities, and metallicities precise to 2\%, 0.1 dex, and 0.05 dex, respectively, for most APOGEE stars, which are predominantly giants. It also provides abundances for up to 15 chemical elements with various levels of precision, typically under 0.1 dex. The final data release (DR12) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III contains an APOGEE database of more than 150,000 stars. ASPCAP development continues in the SDSS-IV APOGEE-2 survey.},

  abstract = {The Gibbs sampler, the algorithm of Metropolis and similar iterative simulation methods are potentially very helpful for summarizing multivariate distributions. Used naively, however, iterative simulation can give misleading answers. Our methods are simple and generally applicable to the output of any iterative simulation; they are designed for researchers primarily interested in the science underlying the data and models they are analyzing, rather than for researchers interested in the probability theory underlying the iterative simulations themselves. Our recommended strategy is to use several independent sequences, with starting points sampled from an overdispersed distribution. At each step of the iterative simulation, we obtain, for each univariate estimand of interest, a distributional estimate and an estimate of how much sharper the distributional estimate might become if the simulations were continued indefinitely. Because our focus is on applied inference for Bayesian posterior distributions in real problems, which often tend toward normality after transformations and marginalization, we derive our results as normal-theory approximations to exact Bayesian inference, conditional on the observed simulations. The methods are illustrated on a random-effects mixture model applied to experimental measurements of reaction times of normal and schizophrenic patients.}

This map covers the sky north of a decl. of -30\textdegree, out to a distance of a few kiloparsecs. This new map contains three major improvements over our previous work. First, the inclusion of Gaia parallaxes dramatically improves distance estimates to nearby stars. Second, we incorporate a spatial prior that correlates the dust density across nearby sightlines. This produces a smoother map, with more isotropic clouds and smaller distance uncertainties, particularly to clouds within the nearest kiloparsec. Third, we infer the dust density with a distance resolution that is four times finer than in our previous work, to accommodate the improvements in signal-to-noise enabled by the other improvements. As part of this work, we infer the distances, reddenings, and types of 799 million stars.

  abstract = {Despite more than 20 years since the discovery of the first gas giant planet with an anomalously large radius, the mechanism for planet inflation remains unknown. Here, we report the discovery of K2-132b, an inflated gas giant planet found with the NASA K2 Mission, and a revised mass for another inflated planet, K2-97b. These planets orbit on {$\asymp$}9 day orbits around host stars that recently evolved into red giants. We constrain the irradiation history of these planets using models constrained by asteroseismology and Keck/High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer spectroscopy and radial velocity measurements. We measure planet radii of 1.31 {$\pm$} 0.11 RJ and 1.30 {$\pm$} 0.07 RJ, respectively. These radii are typical for planets receiving the current irradiation, but not the former, zero age main-sequence irradiation of these planets. This suggests that the current sizes of these planets are directly correlated to their current irradiation. Our precise constraints of the masses and radii of the stars and planets in these systems allow us to constrain the planetary heating efficiency of both systems as 0.03 \%-0.02\%0.03\%. These results are consistent with a planet re-inflation scenario, but suggest that the efficiency of planet re-inflation may be lower than previously theorized. Finally, we discuss the agreement within 10\% of the stellar masses and radii, and the planet masses, radii, and orbital periods of both systems, and speculate that this may be due to selection bias in searching for planets around evolved stars.},

  abstract = {Digital circuits such as the flip-flop use feedback to achieve  multi-stability and nonlinearity to restore signals to logical levels, for example 0 and 1. Analogue feedback circuits are generally designed to operate linearly, so that signals are over a range, and the response is unique. By contrast, the response of cortical circuits to sensory stimulation can be both multistable and graded. We propose that the neocortex combines digital selection of an active set of neurons with analogue response by dynamically varying the positive feedback inherent in its recurrent connections. Strong positive feedback causes differential instabilities that drive the selection of a set of active neurons under the constraints embedded in the synaptic weights. Once selected, the active neurons generate weaker, stable feedback that provides analogue amplification of the input. Here we present our model of cortical processing as an electronic circuit that emulates this hybrid operation, and so is able to perform computations that are similar to stimulus selection, gain modulation and spatiotemporal pattern generation in the neocortex.}

Such parametrized descriptions have little predictive power and often fail to capture the physical nature of the underlying processes responsible for discrepancies between models and observations.

  abstract = {Asteroseismology provides fundamental stellar parameters independent of distance, but subject to systematics under calibration. Gaia DR2 has provided parallaxes for a billion stars, which are offset by a parallax zero-point ({$\varpi$}zp). Red Clump (RC) stars have a narrow spread in luminosity, thus functioning as standard candles to calibrate these systematics. This work measures how the magnitude and spread of the RC in the Kepler field are affected by changes to temperature and scaling relations for seismology, and changes to the parallax zero-point for Gaia. We use a sample of 5576 RC stars classified through asteroseismology. We apply hierarchical Bayesian latent variable models, finding the population-level properties of the RC with seismology, and use those as priors on Gaia parallaxes to find {$\varpi$}zp. We then find the position of the RC, using published values for {$\varpi$}zp. We find a seismic temperature-insensitive spread of the RC of \{{$\sim$} \}0.03 mag in the 2MASS K band and a larger and slightly temperature-dependent spread of \{{$\sim$} \}0.13 mag in the Gaia G band. This intrinsic dispersion in the K band provides a distance precision of \{{$\sim$} \} 1\{\{ per cent\}\} for RC stars. Using Gaia data alone, we find a mean zero-point of -41{$\pm$} 10 {$\mu$} as. This offset yields RC absolute magnitudes of -1.634 {$\pm$} 0.018 in K and 0.546 {$\pm$} 0.016 in G. Obtaining these same values through seismology would require a global temperature shift of \{{$\sim$} \}-70 K, which is compatible with known systematics in spectroscopy.},

  abstract = {Studies using asteroseismic ages and rotation rates from star-spot rotation have indicated that standard age-rotation relations may break down roughly half way through the main sequence lifetime, a phenomenon referred to as weakened magnetic braking. Although rotation rates from spots can be difficult to determine for older, less active stars, rotational splitting of asteroseismic oscillation frequencies can provide rotation rates for both active and quiescent stars, and so can confirm whether this effect really takes place on the main sequence. We obtained asteroseismic rotation rates of 91 main sequence stars showing high signal-to-noise modes of oscillation. Using these new rotation rates, along with effective temperatures, metallicities and seismic masses and ages, we built a hierarchical Bayesian mixture model to determine whether the ensemble more closely agreed with a standard rotational evolution scenario, or one where weakened magnetic braking takes place. The weakened magnetic braking scenario was found to be 98.4\% more likely for our stellar ensemble, adding to the growing body of evidence for this stage of stellar rotational evolution. This work presents a large catalogue of seismic rotation rates for stars on the main sequence, which opens up possibilities for more detailed ensemble analysis of rotational evolution with Kepler.},

  abstract = {Distances to individual stars in our own Galaxy are critical in order to  piece together the nature of its velocity and spatial structure. Core helium burning red clump (RC) stars have similar luminosities, are abundant throughout the Galaxy and thus constitute good standard candles. We build a hierarchical probabilistic model to quantify the quality of RC stars as standard candles using parallax measurements from the first Gaia data release. A unique aspect of our methodology is to fully account for (and marginalize over) parallax, photometry and dust correction uncertainties, which lead to more robust results than standard approaches. We determine the absolute magnitude and intrinsic dispersion of the RC in 2MASS bands J, H, Ks, Gaia G band and WISE bands W1, W2, W3 and W4. We find that the absolute magnitude of the RC is -1.61 {$\pm$} 0.01 (in Ks), +0.44 {$\pm$} 0.01 (in G), -0.93 {$\pm$} 0.01 (in J), -1.46 {$\pm$} 0.01 (in H), -1.68 {$\pm$} 0.02 (in W1), -1.69 {$\pm$} 0.02 (in W2), -1.67 {$\pm$} 0.02 (in W3) and -1.76 {$\pm$} 0.01 mag (in W4). The mean intrinsic dispersion is {$\sim$}0.17 {$\pm$} 0.03 mag across all bands (yielding a typical distance precision of {$\sim$}8 per cent). Thus RC stars are reliable and precise standard candles. In addition, we have also re-calibrated the zero-point of the absolute magnitude of the RC in each band, which provides a benchmark for future studies to estimate distances to RC stars. Finally, the parallax error shrinkage in the hierarchical model outlined in this work can be used to obtain more precise parallaxes than Gaia for the most distant RC stars across the Galaxy.},

  abstract = {Context. The length of the asteroseismic timeseries obtained from the  Kepler satellite analysed here span 19 months. Kepler provides the longest continuous timeseries currently available, which calls for a study of the influence of the increased timespan on the accuracy and precision of the obtained results. Aims: We aim to investigate how the increased timespan influences the detectability of the oscillation modes, and the absolute values and uncertainties of the global oscillation parameters, i.e., frequency of maximum oscillation power, {$\nu$}max, and large frequency separation between modes of the same degree and consecutive orders, {$\langle$} {$\Delta\nu$} {$\rangle$} .  Methods: We use published methods to derive {$\nu$}max and {$\langle$} {$\Delta\nu$} {$\rangle$} for timeseries ranging from 50 to 600 days and compare these results as a function of method, timespan and {$\langle$} {$\Delta\nu$} {$\rangle$} . Results: We find that in general a minimum of the order of 400 day long timeseries are necessary to obtain reliable results for the global oscillation parameters in more than 95\% of the stars, but this does depend on {$\langle$} {$\Delta\nu$} {$\rangle$} . In a statistical sense the quoted uncertainties seem to provide a reasonable indication of the precision of the obtained results in short (50-day) runs, they do however seem to be overestimated for results of longer runs. Furthermore, the different definitions of the global parameters used in the different methods have non-negligible effects on the obtained values. Additionally, we show that there is a correlation between {$\nu$}max and the flux variance. Conclusions: We conclude that longer timeseries improve the likelihood to detect oscillations with automated codes (from \textasciitilde 60\% in 50 day runs to {$>$}95\% in 400 day runs with a slight method dependence) and the precision of the obtained global oscillation parameters. The trends suggest that the improvement will continue for even longer timeseries than the 600 days considered here, with a reduction in the median absolute deviation of more than a factor of 10 for an increase in timespan from 50 to 2000 days (the currently foreseen length of the mission). This work shows that global parameters determined with high precision - thus from long datasets - using different definitions can be used to identify the evolutionary state of the stars. Values of the global oscillation parameters can be obtained from the authors upon request.},

A deep neural network is trained on a precomputed asteroseismology grid containing about 62 million coherent oscillation-mode frequencies derived from stellar evolution models. These models are representative of the core-hydrogen-burning stage of intermediate-mass and high-mass stars. The evolution models constitute a 6D parameter space and their predicted low-degree pressure- and gravity-mode oscillations are scanned using a genetic algorithm. A software pipeline is created to find the best-fitting stellar parameters for a given set of observed oscillation frequencies. The proposed method finds the optimal regions in the 6D parameter space in less than a minute, hence providing the optimal starting point for further and more detailed forward asteroseismic modeling in a high-dimensional context. We test and apply the method to seven pulsating stars that were previously modeled asteroseismically by classical grid-based forward modeling based on a {$\chi$} 2 statistic, and obtain good agreement with past results. Our deep-learning methodology opens up the application of asteroseismic modeling in +6D parameter space for thousands of stars pulsating in coherent modes with long lifetimes observed by the Kepler space telescope and to be discovered with the TESS and PLATO space missions, while applications so far have been done star-by-star for only a handful of cases. Our method is open source and can be freely used by anyone.3}

These features allow it to converge to high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than simpler methods such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, HMC's performance is highly sensitive to two user-specified parameters: a step size {$\epsilon$} and a desired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an extension to HMC that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. NUTS uses a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its steps. Empirically, NUTS performs at least as efficiently as (and sometimes more effciently than) a well tuned standard HMC method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also derive a method for adapting the step size parameter {$\epsilon$} on the fly based on primal-dual averaging. NUTS can thus be used with no hand-tuning at all, making it suitable for applications such as BUGS-style automatic inference engines that require efficient "turnkey" samplers.},

We consider cases of general, heterogeneous, and arbitrarily covariant two-dimensional uncertainties, and situations in which there are bad data (large outliers), unknown uncertainties, and unknown but expected intrinsic scatter in the linear relationship being fit. Above all we emphasize the importance of having a "generative model" for the data, even an approximate one. Once there is a generative model, the subsequent fitting is non-arbitrary because the model permits direct computation of the likelihood of the parameters or the posterior probability distribution. Construction of a posterior probability distribution is indispensible if there are "nuisance parameters" to marginalize away.},

To determine the fundamental properties of a large sample of subgiant stars efficiently, we developed a deep learning method that estimates distributions of fundamental parameters like age and mass over a wide range of input physics by learning from a grid of stellar models varied in eight physical parameters. We applied our method to four Kepler subgiant stars and compare our results with previously determined estimates. Our results show good agreement with previous estimates for three of them (KIC 11026764, KIC 10920273, KIC 11395018). With the ability to explore a vast range of stellar parameters, we determine that the remaining star, KIC 10005473, is likely to have an age 1 Gyr younger than its previously determined estimate. Our method also estimates the efficiency of overshooting, undershooting, and microscopic diffusion processes, from which we determined that the parameters governing such processes are generally poorly constrained in subgiant models. We further demonstrate our method's utility for ensemble asteroseismology by characterizing a sample of 30 Kepler subgiant stars, where we find a majority of our age, mass, and radius estimates agree within uncertainties from more computationally expensive grid-based modelling techniques.},

The first and most fundamental step in such analysis is to identify which stars show oscillations. It is critical that this step be performed with no, or little, detection bias, particularly when performing subsequent ensemble analyses that aim to compare the properties of observed stellar populations with those from galactic models. However, an efficient, automated solution to this initial detection step still has not been found, meaning that expert visual inspection of data from each star is required to obtain the highest level of detections. Hence, to mimic how an expert eye analyzes the data, we use supervised deep learning to not only detect oscillations in red giants, but also to predict the location of the frequency at maximum power, {$\nu$}max, by observing features in 2D images of power spectra. By training on Kepler data, we benchmark our deep-learning classifier against K2 data that are given detections by the expert eye, achieving a detection accuracy of 98\% on K2 Campaign 6 stars and a detection accuracy of 99\% on K2 Campaign 3 stars. We further find that the estimated uncertainty of our deep-learning-based {$\nu$}max predictions is about 5\%. This is comparable to human-level performance using visual inspection. When examining outliers, we find that the deep-learning results are more likely to provide robust {$\nu$}max estimates than the classical model-fitting method.},

  abstract = {Deep learning in the form of 1D convolutional neural networks have  previously been shown to be capable of efficiently classifying the evolutionary state of oscillating red giants into red giant branch stars and helium-core burning stars by recognizing visual features in their asteroseismic frequency spectra. We elaborate further on the deep learning method by developing an improved convolutional neural network classifier. To make our method useful for current and future space missions such as K2, TESS, and PLATO, we train classifiers that are able to classify the evolutionary states of lower frequency resolution spectra expected from these missions. Additionally, we provide new classifications for 8633 Kepler red giants, out of which 426 have previously not been classified using asteroseismology. This brings the total to 14983 Kepler red giants classified with our new neural network. We also verify that our classifiers are remarkably robust to suboptimal data, including low signal-to-noise and incorrect training truth labels.},

  abstract = {Context. Determining the properties of solar-like oscillating stars can be subject to many biases. A particularly important example is the helium-mass degeneracy, where the uncertainties regarding the internal physics can cause a poor determination of both the mass and surface helium content. Accordingly, an independent helium estimate is needed to overcome this degeneracy. A promising way to obtain such an estimate is to exploit the so-called ionisation glitch, that is, the deviation from the asymptotic oscillation frequency pattern caused by the rapid structural variation in the He ionisation zones. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Aims: Although it is progressively becoming more sophisticated, the glitch-based approach faces problems inherent to its current modelling such as the need for calibration using realistic stellar models. This requires a physical model of the ionisation region that explicitly involves the parameters of interest, such as the surface helium abundance, Y\textsubscript{s}. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Methods: Through a thermodynamic treatment of the ionisation region, an analytical approximation for the first adiabatic exponent {$\Gamma$}\textsubscript{1} is presented. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Results: The induced stellar structure is found to depend on only three parameters, including the surface helium abundance Y\textsubscript{s} and the electron degeneracy {$\psi$}\textsubscript{CZ} in the convective region. The model thus defined allows a wide variety of structures to be described, and it is in particular able to approximate a realistic model in the ionisation region. The modelling work we conducted enables us to study the structural perturbations causing the glitch. More elaborate forms of perturbations than those that are usually assumed are found. It is also suggested that there might be a stronger dependence of the structure on the electron degeneracy in the convection zone and on the position of the ionisation region rather than on the amount of helium itself. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Conclusions: When analysing the ionisation glitch signature, we emphasise the importance of having a relation that can take these additional dependences into account.},

  abstract = {In the present paper, we aim to constrain the properties of the ionisation region in a star from the oscillation frequency variation (a so-called glitch) caused by rapid structural variations in this very region. In particular, we seek to avoid the use of calibration based on stellar models thus providing a truly independent estimate of these properties. These include both the helium abundance and other physical quantities that can have a significant impact on the oscillation frequencies such as the electronic degeneracy parameter or the extent of the ionisation region. Taking as a starting point our first paper, we applied structural perturbations of the ionisation zone to the wave equation for radial oscillations in an isentropic region. The resulting glitch model is thus able to exploit the information contained in the fast frequency oscillation caused by the helium ionisation but also in the slow trend accompanying that of hydrogen. This information can directly be expressed in terms of parameters related respectively to the helium abundance, electronic degeneracy and extent of the ionisation region. Using a Bayesian inference, we show that a substantial recovery of the properties at the origin of the glitch is possible. A degeneracy between the helium abundance and the electronic degeneracy is found to exist, which particularly affects the helium estimate. Extending the method to cases where the glitch is subject to contamination (e.g. surface effects), we noted the importance of the slow glitch trend associated with hydrogen ionisation. We propose using a Gaussian process to disentangle the frequency glitch from surface effects.},

The signature in the oscillation frequencies characterizing the ionization-induced depression of the first adiabatic exponent {$\gamma$} is a superposition of two decaying periodic functions of frequency {$\nu$}, with `frequencies' that are approximately twice the acoustic depths of the centres of the HeI and HeII ionization regions. That variation is probably best exhibited in the second frequency difference {$\Delta$}2{$\nu$}n,l {$\equiv$} {$\nu$}n-1,l - 2{$\nu$}n,l + {$\nu$}n+1,l. We show how an analytic approximation to the variation of {$\gamma$} leads to a simple representation of this oscillatory contribution to {$\Delta$}2{$\nu$} which can be used to characterize the {$\gamma$} variation, our intention being to use it as a seismic diagnostic of the helium abundance of the star.

Using evolutionary models, we test asteroseismic scaling relations for the frequency of maximum power ({$\nu$}max), the large frequency separation ({$\Delta\nu$}), and oscillation amplitudes. We show that the difference of the {$\Delta\nu$}-{$\nu$}max relation for unevolved and evolved stars can be explained by different distributions in effective temperature and stellar mass, in agreement with what is expected from scaling relations. For oscillation amplitudes, we show that neither (L/M) s scaling nor the revised scaling relation by Kjeldsen \& Bedding is accurate for red-giant stars, and demonstrate that a revised scaling relation with a separate luminosity-mass dependence can be used to calculate amplitudes from the main sequence to red giants to a precision of \textasciitilde 25\%. The residuals show an offset particularly for unevolved stars, suggesting that an additional physical dependency is necessary to fully reproduce the observed amplitudes. We investigate correlations between amplitudes and stellar activity, and find evidence that the effect of amplitude suppression is most pronounced for subgiant stars. Finally, we test the location of the cool edge of the instability strip in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram using solar-like oscillations and find the detections in the hottest stars compatible with a domain of hybrid stochastically excited and opacity driven pulsation.},

  abstract = {We present the discovery of HD 221416 b, the first transiting planet identified by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) for which asteroseismology of the host star is possible. HD 221416 b (HIP 116158, TOI-197) is a bright (V = 8.2 mag), spectroscopically classified subgiant that oscillates with an average frequency of about 430 {$\mu$}Hz and displays a clear signature of mixed modes. The oscillation amplitude confirms that the redder TESS bandpass compared to Kepler has a small effect on the oscillations, supporting the expected yield of thousands of solar-like oscillators with TESS 2 minute cadence observations. Asteroseismic modeling yields a robust determination of the host star radius (R {$\star$} = 2.943 {$\pm$} 0.064 R {$\odot$}), mass (M {$\star$} = 1.212 {$\pm$} 0.074 M {$\odot$}), and age (4.9 {$\pm$} 1.1 Gyr), and demonstrates that it has just started ascending the red-giant branch. Combining asteroseismology with transit modeling and radial-velocity observations, we show that the planet is a ``hot Saturn'' (R p = 9.17 {$\pm$} 0.33 R {$\oplus$}) with an orbital period of {$\sim$}14.3 days, irradiance of F = 343 {$\pm$} 24 F {$\oplus$}, and moderate mass (M p = 60.5 {$\pm$} 5.7 M {$\oplus$}) and density ({$\rho$} p = 0.431 {$\pm$} 0.062 g cm-3). The properties of HD 221416 b show that the host-star metallicity-planet mass correlation found in sub-Saturns (4-8 R {$\oplus$}) does not extend to larger radii, indicating that planets in the transition between sub-Saturns and Jupiters follow a relatively narrow range of densities. With a density measured to {$\sim$}15\%, HD 221416 b is one of the best characterized Saturn-size planets to date, augmenting the small number of known transiting planets around evolved stars and demonstrating the power of TESS to characterize exoplanets and their host stars using asteroseismology.},

We find no significant offset for main-sequence ({$\lessequivlnt$} 1.5 \{R\}{$\odot$} ) and low-luminosity RGB stars ({$\approx$}3-8 \{R\}{$\odot$} ), but seismic radii appear to be systematically underestimated by {$\approx$}5\% for subgiants ({$\approx$}1.5-3 \{R\}{$\odot$} ).

It is designed to both rehearse interview or exam specific topics and provide machine learning MSc / PhD. students, and those awaiting an interview a well-organized overview of the field. The problems it poses are tough enough to cut your teeth on and to dramatically improve your skills-but they're framed within thought-provoking questions and engaging stories. That is what makes the volume so specifically valuable to students and job seekers: it provides them with the ability to speak confidently and quickly on any relevant topic, to answer technical questions clearly and correctly, and to fully understand the purpose and meaning of interview questions and answers. Those are powerful, indispensable advantages to have when walking into the interview room. The book's contents is a large inventory of numerous topics relevant to DL job interviews and graduate level exams. That places this work at the forefront of the growing trend in science to teach a core set of practical mathematical and computational skills. It is widely accepted that the training of every computer scientist must include the fundamental theorems of ML, and AI appears in the curriculum of nearly every university. This volume is designed as an excellent reference for graduates of such programs.},

  abstract = {The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will detect and characterize \$\textbackslash sim10\^4\$ Galactic Binaries consisting predominantly of two White Dwarfs (WD). An interesting prospect within this population is a third object--another WD star, a Circumbinary Exoplanet (CBP), or a Brown Dwarf (BD)--in orbit about the inner WD pair. We present the first fully Bayesian detection and posterior analysis of sub-stellar objects with LISA, focusing on the characterization of CBPs. We used an optimistic astrophysically motivated catalogue of these CBP third-body sources, including their orbital eccentricity around the inner binary for the first time. We examined Bayesian Evidence computations for detectability, as well as the effects on the posterior distributions for both the inner binary parameters and the third-body parameters. We find that the posterior behavior bifurcates based on whether the third-body period is above or below half the observation time. Additionally, we find that undetectable third-body sources can bias the inner binary parameters whether or not the correct template is used. We used the information retrieved from the study of the CBP population to make an initial conservative prediction for the number of detectable BD systems in the original catalogue. We end with commentary on the predicted qualitative effects on LISA global fitting and Galactic Binary population analysis. The procedure used in this work is generic and can be directly applied to other astrophysical effects expected within the Galactic Binary population.},

Because current models are unable to accurately predict the occurrence and efficiency of mixing processes beyond convective boundaries, one can use the luminosity of the bump\textemdash a diagnostic of the maximum extension of the convective envelope during the first-dredge up\textemdash as a calibrator for such processes. By combining asteroseismic and spectroscopic constraints, we expand the analysis of the bump to masses and metallicities beyond those previously accessible using globular clusters. Our data set comprises nearly 3000 red-giant stars observed by Kepler and with APOGEE spectra. Using statistical mixture models, we are able to detect the bump in the average seismic parameters {$\nu$} max and {$<$} \{\{{$\Delta$} \}\}{$\nu$} {$>$} , and show that its observed position reveals general trends with mass and metallicity in line with expectations from models. Moreover, our analysis indicates that standard stellar models underestimate the depth of efficiently mixed envelopes. The inclusion of significant overshooting from the base of the convective envelope, with an efficiency that increases with decreasing metallicity, allows us to reproduce the observed location of the bump. Interestingly, this trend was also reported in previous studies of globular clusters.},

  abstract = {Context. The Sun and solar-like stars undergo activity cycles for which  the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. The oscillations of the Sun are known to vary with its activity cycle and these changes provide diagnostics on the conditions below the photosphere. Kepler has detected solar-like oscillations in hundreds of stars but as of yet, no widespread detection of signatures of magnetic activity cycles in the oscillation parameters of these stars have been reported. Aims: We analysed the photometric short cadence Kepler time series of a set of 24 solar-like stars, which were observed for at least 960 d each, with the aim to find signatures of stellar magnetic activity in the oscillation parameters. Methods: We analyse the temporal evolution of oscillation parameters by measuring mode frequency shifts, changes in the height of the p-mode envelope, as well as granulation timescales. Results: For 23 of the 24 investigated stars, we find significant frequency shifts in time. We present evidence for magnetic activity in six of these stars. We find that the amplitude of the frequency shifts decreases with stellar age and rotation period. For KIC 8006161 (the most prominent example), we find that frequency shifts are smallest for the lowest and largest for the highest p-mode frequencies, as they are for the Sun. Conclusions: These findings show that magnetic activity can be routinely observed in the oscillation parameters for solar-like stars, which opens up the possibility of placing the solar activity cycle in the context of other stars by asteroseismology.},

  abstract = {Relations between global asteroseismic quantities allow us to derive fundamental stellar parameters. To obtain an insight into solar-like pulsators by an accurate estimate of stellar property requires to explore various scaling relations other than commonly-exploited ones as well as to calibrate the dependence of those over a range of metallicity, mass and evolutionary status of stars. We investigate statistical properties of the width of the Gaussian envelope {$\delta\nu$}env for the stellar oscillation power excess by analyzing light curves of 160 stars observed with short-cadence mode by Kepler. We consider the envelope width as important because it measures the efficiency of excitation and damping of solar-like oscillations due to the turbulence in the outer convective envelope. We attempt to fit a single slope power-law and a broken power-law to relations of {$\delta\nu$}env with {$\nu$}maxand {$\Delta\nu$} resulting from three different background models, each of which delineates the red-noise of the stellar power spectrum. A goodness of fit is provided in term of {$\chi$}2. In the case of a single slope fit the resulting slope ends up with {$\delta\nu$}env / {$\mu$}Hz {$\propto$}({$\nu$}max / {$\mu$}Hz) {$\sim$} 1.47 and {$\delta\nu$}env/{$\mu$}Hz{$\propto$}({$\Delta\nu$}/{$\mu$}Hz) {$\sim$} 1.83 on average, which is somewhat steeper than a previous outcome for red giants. Fitting with two distinct slopes at breaks of {$\nu$}max {$\sim$} 850 {$\mu$} Hz and {$\Delta\nu$} {$\sim$} 50 {$\mu$}Hz, however, suits in the power-law fit than with a single slope in general. Direct fitting in {$\nu$}max -nenv plot yields the power-law index +0.53, apparently steeper than previously reported slope from red giants. The origin of breaks can be illustrated by the attributes in the {$\delta\nu$}env-distribution of main-sequence and sub-giant stars in the seismic H-R diagram.},

Primarily designed to detect planetary transits and asteroseismological signals from solar-like stars, Kepler has provided high-quality data for many areas of investigation. Unconditioned simple aperture time-series photometry is, however, affected by systematic structure. Examples of these systematics include differential velocity aberration, thermal gradients across the spacecraft, and pointing variations. While exhibiting some impact on Kepler's primary science, these systematics can critically handicap potentially ground-breaking scientific gains in other astrophysical areas, especially over long timescales greater than 10 days. As the data archive grows to provide light curves for 105 stars of many years in length, Kepler will only fulfill its broad potential for stellar astrophysics if these systematics are understood and mitigated. Post-launch developments in the Kepler archive, data reduction pipeline and open source data analysis software have helped to remove or reduce systematic artifacts. This paper provides a conceptual primer to help users of the Kepler data archive understand and recognize systematic artifacts within light curves and some methods for their removal. Specific examples of artifact mitigation are provided using data available within the archive. Through the methods defined here, the Kepler community will find a road map to maximizing the quality and employment of the Kepler legacy archive.}

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

In the modern era of large surveys tiling the sky at ever high precision and sampling rates, these serendipitous discoveries look set to continue, with recent examples including Boyajian's Star, Fast Radio Bursts and `Oumuamua. Accordingly, we here look ahead and aim to provide a statistical framework for interpreting such events and providing guidance to future observations, under the basic premise that the phenomenon in question stochastically repeat at some unknown, constant rate, \$\textbackslash lambda\$. Specifically, expressions are derived for 1) the a-posteriori distribution for \$\textbackslash lambda\$, 2) the a-posteriori distribution for the recurrence time, and, 3) the benefit-to-cost ratio of further observations relative to that of the inaugural event. Some rule-of-thumb results for each of these are found to be 1) \$\textbackslash lambda {$<$} \textbackslash\{0.7, 2.3, 4.6\textbackslash\}\textbackslash,t\_1\^\{-1\}\$ to \$\textbackslash\{50, 90, 95\textbackslash\}\textbackslash\%\$ confidence (where \$t\_1=\$ time to obtain the first detection), 2) the recurrence time is \$t\_2 {$<$} \textbackslash\{1, 9, 99\textbackslash\}\textbackslash,t\_1\$ to \$\textbackslash\{50, 90, 95\textbackslash\}\textbackslash\%\$ confidence, with a lack of repetition by time \$t\_2\$ yielding a \$p\$-value of \$1/[1+(t\_2/t\_1)]\$, and, 3) follow-up for \$\textbackslash lesssim 10\textbackslash,t\_1\$ is expected to be scientifically worthwhile under an array of differing assumptions about the object's intrinsic scientific value.

  abstract = {There are no good predictions for the amplitudes expected from solar-like oscillations in other stars. In the absence of a definitive model for convection, which is thought to be the mechanism that excites these oscillations, the amplitudes for both velocity and luminosity measurements must be estimated by scaling from the Sun. In the case of luminosity measurements, even this is difficult because of disagreement over the solar amplitude. This last point has lead us to investigate whether the luminosity amplitude of oscillations {$\delta$}L/L can be derived from the velocity amplitude (v\_osc\_). Using linear theory and observational data, we show that p-mode oscillations in a large sample of pulsating stars satisfy ({$\delta$}L/L)\_bol\_\{prop.to\} v\_osc\_/T\_eff\_. Using this relationship, together with the best estimate of v\_osc\_,sun\_=(23.4+/-1.4)cm/s, we estimate the luminosity amplitude of solar oscillations at 550nm to be {$\delta$}L/L=(4.7+/-0.3)ppm. Next we discuss how to scale the amplitude of solar-like (i.e., convectively-powered) oscillations from the Sun to other stars. The only predictions come from model calculations by Christensen-Dalsgaard \& Frandsen (1983, Sol. Phys. 82, 469). However, their grid of stellar models is not dense enough to allow amplitude predictions for an arbitrary star. Nevertheless, although convective theory is complicated, we might expect that the general properties of convection - including oscillation amplitudes - should change smoothly through the colour-magnitude diagram. Indeed, we find that the velocity amplitudes predicted by the model calculations are well fitted by the relation v\_osc\_\{prop.to\}L/M. These two relations allow us to predict both the velocity and luminosity amplitudes of solar-like oscillations in any given star. We compare these predictions with published observations and evaluate claims for detections that have appeared in the literature. We argue that there is not yet good evidence for solar-like oscillations in any star except the Sun. For solar-type stars (e.g., {$\alpha$} Cen A and {$\beta$} Hyi), observations have not yet reached sufficient sensitivity to detect the amplitudes we predict. For some F-type stars, namely Procyon and several members of M67, detection sensitivities 30-40\% below the predicted amplitudes have been achieved. We conclude that these stars must oscillate with amplitudes less than has generally been assumed.},

The spectroscopic stellar parameters, in particular stellar parameter differences between groups of stars, are in good agreement with broadband and Str\"omgren photometry calibrated on the infrared flux method. The spectroscopic abundance analysis reveals, for the first time, systematic trends of iron abundance with evolutionary stage. Iron is found to be 30\% less abundant in the turnoff point stars than in the red giants. An abundance difference in lithium is seen between the turnoff point and warm subgiant stars. The impact of potential systematic errors on these abundance trends (stellar parameters, the hydrostatic and LTE approximations) is quantitatively evaluated and found not to alter our conclusions significantly. Trends for various elements (Li, Mg, Ca, Ti, and Fe) are compared with stellar structure models including the effects of atomic diffusion and radiative acceleration. Such models are found to describe the observed element-specific trends well, if extra (turbulent) mixing just below the convection zone is introduced. It is concluded that atomic diffusion and turbulent mixing are largely responsible for the subprimordial stellar lithium abundances of warm halo stars. Other consequences of atomic diffusion in old metal-poor stars are also discussed.

This hierarchical method therefore provides a means to both accurately and robustly extract inclination angles from red giant stars. We successfully apply this technique to an artificial data set with an underlying isotropic inclination angle distribution to verify the method. We also apply this technique to 123 red giant stars observed with Kepler. We also show the need for a selection function to account for possible population-level biases, which are not present in individual star-by-star cases, in order to extend the hierarchical method towards inferring underlying population inclination angle distributions.},

For instance, they are crucial for constraining scenarii of planetary formation and evolution. Aims: We aim at quantifying how detailed stellar modelling can improve the accuracy and precision on age and mass of individual stars. To that end, we adopt a multifaceted approach where we carefully examine how the number of observational constraints as well as the uncertainties on observations and on model input physics affect the results of age-dating and weighing. Methods: We modelled in detail the exoplanet host-star HD 52265, a main-sequence, solar-like oscillator that CoRoT observed for four months. We considered different sets of observational constraints (Hertzsprung-Russell data, metallicity, various sets of seismic constraints). For each case, we determined the age, mass, and properties of HD 52265 inferred from stellar models, and we quantified the impact of the model input physics and free parameters. We also compared model ages with ages derived by empirical methods or Hertzsprung-Russell diagram inversion. Results: For our case study HD 52265, our seismic analysis provides an age A = 2.10-2.54 Gyr, a mass M = 1.14-1.32 M{$\odot$}, and a radius R = 1.30-1.34 R{$\odot$}, which corresponds to age, mass, and radius uncertainties of \textasciitilde 10, \textasciitilde 7, and \textasciitilde 1.5 per cent, respectively. These uncertainties account for observational errors and current state-of-the-art stellar model uncertainties. Our seismic study also provides constraints on surface convection properties through the mixing-length, which we find to be 12-15 per cent lower than the solar value. On the other hand, because of helium-mass degeneracy, the initial helium abundance is determined modulo the mass value. Finally, we evaluate the seismic mass of the exoplanet to be Mpsini = 1.17-1.26 MJupiter, much more precise than what can be derived by Hertzsprung-Russell diagram inversion. Conclusions: We demonstrate that asteroseismology allows us to substantially improve the age accuracy that can be achieved with other methods. We emphasize that the knowledge of the mean properties of stellar oscillations - such as the large frequency separation - is not enough to derive accurate ages. We need precise individual frequencies to narrow the age scatter that is a result of the model input physics uncertainties. Further progress is required to better constrain the physics at work in stars and the stars helium content. Our results emphasize the importance of precise classical stellar parameters and oscillation frequencies such as will be obtained by the Gaia and PLATO missions.

  abstract = {We present a hierarchical probabilistic model for improving geometric  stellar distance estimates using color-magnitude information. This is achieved with a data-driven model of the color-magnitude diagram, not relying on stellar models but instead on the relative abundances of stars in color-magnitude cells, which are inferred from very noisy magnitudes and parallaxes. While the resulting noise-deconvolved color-magnitude diagram can be useful for a range of applications, we focus on deriving improved stellar distance estimates relying on both parallax and photometric information. We demonstrate the efficiency of this approach on the 1.4 million stars of the Gaia TGAS sample that also have AAVSO Photometric All Sky Survey magnitudes. Our hierarchical model has 4 million parameters in total, most of which are marginalized out numerically or analytically. We find that distance estimates are significantly improved for the noisiest parallaxes and densest regions of the color-magnitude diagram. In particular, the average distance signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) and uncertainty improve by 19\% and 36\%, respectively, with 8\% of the objects improving in S/N by a factor greater than 2. This computationally efficient approach fully accounts for both parallax and photometric noise and is a first step toward a full hierarchical probabilistic model of the Gaia data.},

High-quality  observations of eclipsing binary stars observed by Kepler offer a great opportunity to calibrate model parameters for evolved stars. Our study focuses on six Kepler red giants with the goal of calibrating the mixing-length parameter of convection as well as the asteroseismic surface term in models. We introduce a new method to improve the identification of oscillation modes that exploits theoretical frequencies to guide the mode identification (`peak-bagging') stage of the data analysis. Our results indicate that the convective mixing-length parameter ({$\alpha$}) is {$\approx$}14 per cent larger for red giants than for the Sun, in agreement with recent results from modelling the APOGEE stars. We found that the asteroseismic surface term (i.e. the frequency offset between the observed and predicted modes) correlates with stellar parameters (Teff, log g) and the mixing-length parameter. This frequency offset generally decreases as giants evolve. The two coefficients a-1 and a3 for the inverse and cubic terms that have been used to describe the surface term correction are found to correlate linearly. The effect of the surface term is also seen in the p-g mixed modes; however, established methods for correcting the effect are not able to properly correct the g-dominated modes in late evolved stars.},

This paper demonstrates an application of a machine-learning algorithm using the Gaussian Process (GP) Regression that turns a sparse model grid on to a continuous function. We train GP models to map five fundamental inputs (mass, equivalent evolutionary phase, initial metallicity, initial helium fraction, and the mixing-length parameter) to observable outputs (effective temperature, surface gravity, radius, surface metallicity, and stellar age). We test the GP predictions for the five outputs using off-grid stellar models and find no obvious systematic offsets, indicating good accuracy in predictions. As a further validation, we apply these GP models to characterize 1000 fake stars. Inferred masses and ages determined with GP models well recover true values within one standard deviation. An important consequence of using GP-based interpolation is that stellar ages are more precise than those estimated with the original sparse grid because of the full sampling of fundamental inputs.},

We do so by combining previous measurements from the literature using a hierarchical Bayesian (HB) statistical method that allows us to account for the possibility that any value may be incorrect or have underestimated errors. We show that this method is robust to a wide variety of assumptions about the nature of problems in individual measurements or error estimates. Ultimately, our analysis yields an SFR for the Galaxy of \{\{\textbackslash dot\{M\}\}\textbackslash star \}=1.65+/- 0.19 \{\{M\}{$\odot$} \} y\{\{r\}-1\}, assuming a Kroupa initial mass function (IMF). By combining HB methods with Monte Carlo simulations that incorporate the latest estimates of the Galactocentric radius of the Sun, R0, the exponential scale length of the disk, Ld, and the local surface density of stellar mass, \{\{{$\Sigma\rbrace\backslash$}star \}(\{\{R\}0\}), we show that the mass of the Galactic bulge+bar is M\textbackslash star B=0.91+/- 0.07\texttimes{} \{\{10\}10\} \{\{M\}{$\odot$} \}, the disk mass is M\textbackslash star D=5.17+/- 1.11\texttimes{} \{\{10\}10\} \{\{M\}{$\odot$} \}, and their combination yields a total stellar mass of \{\{M\}\textbackslash star \}=6.08+/- 1.14\texttimes{} \{\{10\}10\} \{\{M\}{$\odot$} \} (assuming a Kroupa IMF and an exponential disk profile). This analysis is based upon a new compilation of literature bulge mass estimates, normalized to common assumptions about the stellar IMF and Galactic disk properties, presented herein.

  abstract = {Context. Gaia Data Release 2 (Gaia DR2) contains results for 1693 million sources in the magnitude range 3 to 21 based on observations collected by the European Space Agency Gaia satellite during the first 22 months of its operational phase. Aims: We describe the input data, models, and processing used for the astrometric content of Gaia DR2, and the validation of these resultsperformed within the astrometry task. Methods: Some 320 billion centroid positions from the pre-processed astrometric CCD observations were used to estimate the five astrometric parameters (positions, parallaxes, and proper motions) for 1332 million sources, and approximate positions at the reference epoch J2015.5 for an additional 361 million mostly faint sources. These data were calculated in two steps. First, the satellite attitude and the astrometric calibration parameters of the CCDs were obtained in an astrometric global iterative solution for 16 million selected sources, using about 1\% of the input data. This primary solution was tied to the extragalactic International Celestial Reference System (ICRS) by means of quasars. The resulting attitude and calibration were then used to calculate the astrometric parameters of all the sources. Special validation solutions were used to characterise the random and systematic errors in parallax and proper motion. Results: For the sources with five-parameter astrometric solutions, the median uncertainty in parallax and position at the reference epoch J2015.5 is about 0.04 mas for bright (G {$<$} 14 mag) sources, 0.1 mas at G = 17 mag, and 0.7 masat G = 20 mag. In the proper motion components the corresponding uncertainties are 0.05, 0.2, and 1.2 mas yr-1, respectively.The optical reference frame defined by Gaia DR2 is aligned with ICRS and is non-rotating with respect to the quasars to within 0.15 mas yr-1. From the quasars and validation solutions we estimate that systematics in the parallaxes depending on position, magnitude, and colour are generally below 0.1 mas, but the parallaxes are on the whole too small by about 0.03 mas. Significant spatial correlations of up to 0.04 mas in parallax and 0.07 mas yr-1 in proper motion are seen on small ({$<$} 1 deg) and intermediate (20 deg) angular scales. Important statistics and information for the users of the Gaia DR2 astrometry are given in the appendices.},

  abstract = {Based on detailed 2D numerical radiation hydrodynamics (RHD)  calculations of time-dependent compressible convection, we have studied the dynamics and thermal structure of the convective surface layers of solar-type stars. The RHD models provide information about the convective efficiency in the superadiabatic region at the top of convective envelopes and predict the asymptotic value of the entropy of the deep, adiabatically stratified layers (Fig. \textbackslash ref\{f:sstarhd\}). This information is translated into an effective mixing-length parameter \textbackslash alphaMLT suitable to construct standard stellar structure models. We validate the approach by a detailed comparison to helioseismic data. The grid of RHD models for solar metallicity comprises 58 simulation runs with a helium abundance of Y=0.28 in the range of effective temperatures 4300pun \{K\}{$<$}=Teff{$<$}= 7100pun \{K\} and gravities 2.54{$<$}=\{log g\}{$<$}= 4.74. We find a moderate, nevertheless significant variation of \textbackslash alphaMLT between about 1.3 for F-dwarfs and 1.75 for K-subgiants with a dominant dependence on Teff (Fig. \textbackslash ref\{f:mlp\}). In the close neighbourhood of the Sun we find a plateau where \textbackslash alphaMLT remains almost constant. The internal accuracy of the calibration of \textbackslash alphaMLT is estimated to be +/- 0.05 with a possible systematic bias towards lower values. An analogous calibration of the convection theory of Canuto \&\textbackslash{} Mazzitelli (1991, 1992; CMT) gives a different temperature dependence but a similar variation of the free parameter (Fig. \textbackslash ref\{f:mlpcm\}). For the first time, values for the gravity-darkening exponent beta are derived independently of mixing-length theory: beta = 0.07... 0.10. We show that our findings are consistent with constraints from stellar stability considerations and provide compact fitting formulae for the calibrations.},

  abstract = {Aims: We investigate the relation between 1D atmosphere models  that rely on the mixing length theory and models based on full 3D radiative hydrodynamic (RHD) calculations to describe convection in the envelopes of late-type stars. Methods: The adiabatic entropy value of the deep convection zone, sbot, and the entropy jump, {$\Delta$}s, determined from the 3D RHD models, were matched with the mixing length parameter, {$\alpha$}MLT, from 1D hydrostatic atmosphere models with identical microphysics (opacities and equation-of-state). We also derived the mass mixing length parameter, {$\alpha$}m, and the vertical correlation length of the vertical velocity, C[vz,vz], directly from the 3D hydrodynamical simulations of stellar subsurface convection.  Results: The calibrated mixing length parameter for the Sun is {$\alpha$}๏MLT (Sbot) = 1.98. . For different stellar parameters, {$\alpha$}MLT varies systematically in the range of 1.7 - 2.4. In particular, {$\alpha$}MLT decreases towards higher effective temperature, lower surface gravity and higher metallicity. We find equivalent results for {$\alpha$}๏MLT ({$\Delta$}S). In addition, we find a tight correlation between the mixing length parameter and the inverse entropy jump. We derive an analytical expression from the hydrodynamic mean-field equations that motivates the relation to the mass mixing length parameter, {$\alpha$}m, and find that it qualitatively shows a similar variation with stellar parameter (between 1.6 and 2.4) with the solar value of {$\alpha$}๏m = 1.83.. The vertical correlation length scaled with the pressure scale height yields 1.71 for the Sun, but only displays a small systematic variation with stellar parameters, the correlation length slightly increases with Teff.  Conclusions: We derive mixing length parameters for various stellar parameters that can be used to replace a constant value. Within any convective envelope, {$\alpha$}m and related quantities vary strongly. Our results will help to replace a constant {$\alpha$}MLT.

  abstract = {The Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE), one of the programs in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III (SDSS-III), has now completed its systematic, homogeneous spectroscopic survey sampling all major populations of the Milky Way. After a three-year observing campaign on the Sloan 2.5 m Telescope, APOGEE has collected a half million high-resolution (R {$\sim$} 22,500), high signal-to-noise ratio ({$>$}100), infrared (1.51-1.70 {$\mu$}m) spectra for 146,000 stars, with time series information via repeat visits to most of these stars. This paper describes the motivations for the survey and its overall design\textemdash hardware, field placement, target selection, operations\textemdash and gives an overview of these aspects as well as the data reduction, analysis, and products. An index is also given to the complement of technical papers that describe various critical survey components in detail. Finally, we discuss the achieved survey performance and illustrate the variety of potential uses of the data products by way of a number of science demonstrations, which span from time series analysis of stellar spectral variations and radial velocity variations from stellar companions, to spatial maps of kinematics, metallicity, and abundance patterns across the Galaxy and as a function of age, to new views of the interstellar medium, the chemistry of star clusters, and the discovery of rare stellar species. As part of SDSS-III Data Release 12 and later releases, all of the APOGEE data products are publicly available.},

  abstract = {We introduce a new methodology to robustly determine the mass profile,  as well as the overall distribution, of Local Group satellite galaxies. Specifically, we employ a statistical multilevel modelling technique, Bayesian hierarchical modelling, to simultaneously constrain the properties of individual Local Group Milky Way satellite galaxies and the characteristics of the Milky Way satellite population. We show that this methodology reduces the uncertainty in individual dwarf galaxy mass measurements up to a factor of a few for the faintest galaxies. We find that the distribution of Milky Way satellites inferred by this analysis, with the exception of the apparent lack of high-mass haloes, is consistent with the {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter ({$\Lambda$}CDM) paradigm. In particular, we find that both the measured relationship between the maximum circular velocity and the radius at this velocity, as well as the inferred relationship between the mass within 300 pc and luminosity, match the values predicted by {$\Lambda$}CDM simulations for haloes with maximum circular velocities below 20 km s-1. Perhaps more striking is that this analysis seems to suggest a more cusped `average' halo shape that is shared by these galaxies. While this study reconciles many of the observed properties of the Milky Way satellite distribution with that of {$\Lambda$}CDM simulations, we find that there is still a deficit of satellites with maximum circular velocities of 20-40 km s-1.},

  abstract = {Modern deep neural network training is typically based on mini-batch stochastic gradient optimization. While the use of large mini-batches increases the available computational parallelism, small batch training has been shown to provide improved generalization performance and allows a significantly smaller memory footprint, which might also be exploited to improve machine throughput. In this paper, we review common assumptions on learning rate scaling and training duration, as a basis for an experimental comparison of test performance for different mini-batch sizes. We adopt a learning rate that corresponds to a constant average weight update per gradient calculation (i.e., per unit cost of computation), and point out that this results in a variance of the weight updates that increases linearly with the mini-batch size \$m\$. The collected experimental results for the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets show that increasing the mini-batch size progressively reduces the range of learning rates that provide stable convergence and acceptable test performance. On the other hand, small mini-batch sizes provide more up-to-date gradient calculations, which yields more stable and reliable training. The best performance has been consistently obtained for mini-batch sizes between \$m = 2\$ and \$m = 32\$, which contrasts with recent work advocating the use of mini-batch sizes in the thousands.},

Such sharp features inside the acoustic cavity of the star, which we call acoustic glitches, create small oscillatory deviations from the uniform spacing of frequencies in a sequence of oscillation modes with the same spherical harmonic degree. We use these oscillatory signals to determine the acoustic locations of such features in 19 solar-type stars observed by the Kepler mission. Four independent groups of researchers utilized the oscillation frequencies themselves, the second differences of the frequencies and the ratio of the small and large separation to locate the base of the convection zone and the second helium ionization zone. Despite the significantly different methods of analysis, good agreement was found between the results of these four groups, barring a few cases. These results also agree reasonably well with the locations of these layers in representative models of the stars. These results firmly establish the presence of the oscillatory signals in the asteroseismic data and the viability of several techniques to determine the location of acoustic glitches inside stars.},

This is because the effective temperature in these stars is not high enough to allow helium ionization, not allowing any conclusions on its abundance when spectroscopic techniques are employed. To this end, stellar modellers resort to estimating the initial helium abundance via a semi-empirical helium-to-heavy element ratio, anchored to the the standard Big Bang nucleosynthesis value. Depending on the choice of solar composition used in stellar model computations, the helium-to-heavy element ratio, (\$\textbackslash Delta Y/\textbackslash Delta Z\$) is found to vary between 1 and 3. In this study, we use the Kepler "LEGACY" stellar sample, for which precise seismic data is available, and explore the systematic uncertainties on the inferred stellar parameters (radius, mass, and age) arising from adopting different values of \$\textbackslash Delta Y/\textbackslash Delta Z\$, specifically, 1.4 and 2.0. The stellar grid constructed with a higher \$\textbackslash Delta Y / \textbackslash Delta Z\$ value yields lower radius and mass estimates. We found systematic uncertainties of 1.1 per cent, 2.6 per cent, and 13.1 per cent on radius, mass, and ages, respectively.},

  abstract = {In many real-world applications, we are interested in approximating black-box, costly functions as accurately as possible with the smallest number of function evaluations. A complex computer code is an example of such a function. In this work, a Gaussian process (GP) emulator is used to approximate the output of complex computer code. We consider the problem of extending an initial experiment (set of model runs) sequentially to improve the emulator. A sequential sampling approach based on leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation is proposed that can be easily extended to a batch mode. This is a desirable property since it saves the user time when parallel computing is available. After fitting a GP to training data points, the expected squared LOO (ES-LOO) error is calculated at each design point. ES-LOO is used as a measure to identify important data points. More precisely, when this quantity is large at a point it means that the quality of prediction depends a great deal on that point and adding more samples nearby could improve the accuracy of the GP. As a result, it is reasonable to select the next sample where ES-LOO is maximised. However, ES-LOO is only known at the experimental design and needs to be estimated at unobserved points. To do this, a second GP is fitted to the ES-LOO errors and where the maximum of the modified expected improvement (EI) criterion occurs is chosen as the next sample. EI is a popular acquisition function in Bayesian optimisation and is used to trade-off between local/global search. However, it has a tendency towards exploitation, meaning that its maximum is close to the (current) "best" sample. To avoid clustering, a modified version of EI, called pseudo expected improvement, is employed which is more explorative than EI yet allows us to discover unexplored regions. Our results show that the proposed sampling method is promising.},

In particular, if in the Sun such a feature were located well inside the acoustic cavity of many solar p modes, it would give rise to a signal that was a periodic function of the frequency of the modes. We use this signature to detect the base of the solar convection zone and to investigate the existence of convective overshoot into the radiative interior. Two methods are considered. The 'absolute' method obtains the residuals in the frequencies after making a smooth fit in mode order n, and then uses an asymptotic description of the eigenfunctions to make a fit to the residuals. The 'differential' method makes an asymptotic fit to the differences between solar frequencies and the frequencies of a theoretical model. Various theoretical models of overshoot at the base of the convection zone predict the existence of a rather abrupt transition to subadiabatic stratification at the base of the overshoot region. We find no strong evidence for the existence of an overshoot region of this kind. Indeed if the overshoot consists of an essentially adiabatic extension of the convection zone followed by an abrupt transition to radiative stratification then we may (at the 95\% confidence level) put an upper limit of 0.07 local pressure scale heights on the extent of the overshoot layer.},

One of these aspects is the convective overshoot that takes place at the borders of the envelopes of stars of mass similar to, or lower than, the Sun. It affects the temperature stratification, mixing, rotation and magnetic-field generation. Asteroseismology can provide an observational test for the studies of the structure of such overshoot regions. The seismic study of the transition in the Sun, located at the base of the convection zone, has been successful in determining the characteristics of this layer in the Sun. In this work we consider the extension of the analysis to other solar-type stars (of mass between 0.85 and 1.2Msolar) in order to establish a method for determining the characteristics of their convective envelopes. In particular, we hope to be able to establish seismologically that a star does indeed possess a convective envelope, to measure the size of the convective region and also to constrain the properties of an overshoot layer at the bottom of the envelope. The limitations in terms of observational uncertainties and stellar characteristics, and the detectability of an overshoot layer, are discussed.},

Therefore, we may hope to be able to use the characteristic periodic signal in the frequencies of oscillation, arising from such a localized perturbation, to determine important aspects of this region. In this poster we present the theoretical analysis of such a signal showing how its different characteristics are associated with the different physical aspects contributing for the zone of the second ionization of helium. Some of these aspects we consider are the envelope helium abundance and the properties of the equation of state (EOS).

Other advantages are the monitoring by only one parameter of the accuracy and its improvement by super-convergence. An automatic mesh refinement has been designed for adjusting the localisations of grid points according to the changes of unknowns. For standard models, the evolution of the chemical composition is solved by stiffly stable schemes of orders up to four; in the convection zones mixing and evolution of chemical are simultaneous. The solution of the diffusion equation employs the Galerkin finite elements scheme; the mixing of chemicals is then performed by a strong turbulent diffusion.

Measuring their properties is therefore extremely important to probe the core, but requires some care, due to the complexity of the mixed-mode pattern. Aims: The aim of this work is to provide a consistent description of the mixed-mode pattern of low-mass stars, based on the asymptotic expansion. We also study the variation of the gravity offset {$\varepsilon$}g with stellar evolution. Methods: We revisit previous works about mixed modes in red giants and empirically test how period spacings, rotational splittings, mixed-mode widths, and heights can be estimated in a consistent view, based on the properties of the mode inertia ratios. Results: From the asymptotic fit of the mixed-mode pattern of a large set of red giants at various evolutionary stages, we derive unbiased and precise asymptotic parameters. As the asymptotic expansion of gravity modes is verified with a precision close to the frequency resolution for stars on the red giant branch (10-4 in relative values), we can derive accurate values of the asymptotic parameters. We decipher the complex pattern in a rapidly rotating star, and explain how asymmetrical splittings can be inferred. We also revisit the stellar inclinations in two open clusters, NGC 6819 and NGC 6791: our results show that the stellar inclinations in these clusters do not have privileged orientation in the sky. The variation of the asymptotic gravity offset with stellar evolution is investigated in detail. We also derive generic properties that explain under which conditions mixed modes can be observed.

Aims: This work aims at disentangling the rotational splittings from the mixed-mode spacings in order to open the way to a fully automated analysis of large data sets. Methods: An analytical development of the mixed-mode asymptotic expansion is used to derive the period spacing between two consecutive mixed modes. The \'echelle diagrams constructed with the appropriately stretched periods are used to exhibit the structure of the gravity modes and of the rotational splittings. Results: We propose a new view of the mixed-mode oscillation pattern based on corrected periods, called stretched periods, that mimic the evenly spaced gravity-mode pattern. This provides a direct understanding of all oscillation components, even in the case of rapid rotation. In this way, the measurement of the asymptotic period spacing and the signature of the structural glitches on mixed modes can be performed easily. Conclusions: This work makes it possible to derive all seismic global parameters in an automated way, including the identification of the different rotational multiplets and the measurement of the rotational splitting, even when this splitting is significantly larger than the period spacing.

Recent space- and ground-based facilities have improved the quantity of stars with accurate observations. This has opened the door for using Bayesian inference tools to maximise the information we can extract from them. Our aim is to present accurate and reliable stellar age estimates of FGK stars using chemical abundances and stellar parameters. We used one of the most flexible Bayesian inference techniques (hierarchical Bayesian models) to exceed current possibilities in the use of chemical abundances for stellar dating. Our model is a data-driven model. We used a training set that has been presented in the literature with ages estimated with isochrones and accurate stellar abundances and general characteristics. The core of the model is a prescription of certain abundance ratios as linear combinations of stellar properties including age. We gathered four different testing sets to assess the accuracy, precision, and limits of our model. We also trained a model using chemical abundances alone. We found that our age estimates and those coming from asteroseismology, other accurate sources, and also with ten Gaia benchmark stars agree well. The mean absolute difference of our estimates compared with those used as reference is 0.9 Ga, with a mean difference of 0.01 Ga. When using open clusters, we reached a very good agreement for Hyades, NGC 2632, Ruprecht 147, and IC4651. We also found outliers that are a reflection of chemical peculiarities and/or stars at the limit of the validity ranges of the training set. The model that only uses chemical abundances shows slightly worse mean absolute difference (1.18 Ga) and mean difference (-0.12 Ga).},

  abstract = {Asteroseismology is an exceptional tool for studying stars using the  properties of observed modes of oscillation. So far the process of performing an asteroseismic analysis of a star has remained somewhat esoteric and inaccessible to nonexperts. In this software paper we describe PBjam, an open-source Python package for analyzing the frequency spectra of solar-like oscillators in a simple but principled and automated way. The aim of PBjam is to provide a set of easy-to-use tools to extract information about the radial and quadropole oscillations in stars that oscillate like the Sun, which may then be used to infer bulk properties such as stellar mass, radius, age, or even structure. Asteroseismology and its data analysis methods are becoming increasingly important as space-based photometric observatories are producing a wealth of new data, allowing asteroseismology to be applied in a wide range of contexts such as exoplanet, stellar structure and evolution, and Galactic population studies.  * Release 1.0.0 Zenodo, doi:10.5281/zenodo.4300079.},

Current and future space-based observatories such as the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and PLATO are set to provide an enormous amount of new data on oscillating stars, and in particular stars that oscillate similar to the Sun. Solar-like oscillators constitute the majority of known oscillating stars and so automated analysis methods are becoming an ever increasing necessity to make as much use of these data as possible. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Aims: Here we aim to construct an algorithm that can automatically determine if a given time series of photometric measurements shows evidence of solar-like oscillations. The algorithm is aimed at analyzing data from the TESS mission and the future PLATO mission, and in particular stars in the main-sequence and subgiant evolutionary stages. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Methods: The algorithm first tests the range of observable frequencies in the power spectrum of a TESS light curve for an excess that is consistent with that expected from solar-like oscillations. In addition, the algorithm tests if a repeating pattern of oscillation frequencies is present in the time series, and whether it is consistent with the large separation seen in solar-like oscillators. Both methods use scaling relations and observations which were established and obtained during the CoRoT, Kepler, and K2 missions. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Results: Using a set of test data consisting of visually confirmed solar-like oscillators and nonoscillators observed by TESS, we find that the proposed algorithm can attain a 94.7\% true positive (TP) rate and a 8.2\% false positive (FP) rate at peak accuracy. However, by applying stricter selection criteria, the FP rate can be reduced to {$\approx$} 2\%, while retaining an 80\% TP rate.},

A previous study of solar twin stars has revealed the existence  of correlations between some abundance ratios and stellar age providing new knowledge about nucleosynthesis and Galactic chemical evolution. Aims: High-precision abundances of elements are determined for stars with asteroseismic ages in order to test the solar twin relations. Methods: HARPS-N spectra with signal-to-noise ratios S/N {$\greaterequivlnt$} 250 and MARCS model atmospheres were used to derive abundances of C, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Fe, Ni, Zn, and Y in ten stars from the Kepler LEGACY sample (including the binary pair 16 Cyg A and B) selected to have metallicities in the range - 0.15 {$<$} [ Fe / H ] {$<$} + 0.15 and ages between 1 and 7 Gyr. Stellar gravities were obtained from seismic data and effective temperatures were determined by comparing non-LTE iron abundances derived from Fe I and Fe II lines. Available non-LTE corrections were also applied when deriving abundances of the other elements. Results: The abundances of the Kepler stars support the [X/Fe]-age relations previously found for solar twins. [Mg/Fe], [Al/Fe], and [Zn/Fe] decrease by 0.1 dex over the lifetime of the Galactic thin disk due to delayed contribution of iron from Type Ia supernovae relative to prompt production of Mg, Al, and Zn in Type II supernovae. [Y/Mg] and [Y/Al], on the other hand, increase by 0.3 dex, which can be explained by an increasing contribution of s-process elements from low-mass AGB stars as time goes on. The trends of [C/Fe] and [O/Fe] are more complicated due to variations of the ratio between refractory and volatile elements among stars of similar age. Two stars with about the same age as the Sun show very different trends of [X/H] as a function of elemental condensation temperature Tc and for 16 Cyg, the two components have an abundance difference, which increases with Tc. These anomalies may be connected to planet-star interactions.

The need to take into account all possible sources of error is of paramount importance towards a robust determination of stellar properties. We present a study of 34 solar-type stars for which high signal-to-noise asteroseismic data are available from multiyear Kepler photometry. We explore the internal systematics on the stellar properties, that is associated with the uncertainty in the input physics used to construct the stellar models. In particular, we explore the systematics arising from (i) the inclusion of the diffusion of helium and heavy elements; (ii) the uncertainty in solar metallicity mixture; and (iii) different surface correction methods used in optimization/fitting procedures. The systematics arising from comparing results of models with and without diffusion are found to be 0.5 per cent, 0.8 per cent, 2.1 per cent, and 16 per cent in mean density, radius, mass, and age, respectively. The internal systematics in age are significantly larger than the statistical uncertainties. We find the internal systematics resulting from the uncertainty in solar metallicity mixture to be 0.7 per cent in mean density, 0.5 per cent in radius, 1.4 per cent in mass, and 6.7 per cent in age. The surface correction method by Sonoi et al. and Ball \& Gizon's two-term correction produce the lowest internal systematics among the different correction methods, namely, {$\sim$}1 per cent, {$\sim$}1 per cent, {$\sim$}2 per cent, and {$\sim$}8 per cent in mean density, radius, mass, and age, respectively. Stellar masses obtained using the surface correction methods by Kjeldsen et al. and Ball \& Gizon's one-term correction are systematically higher than those obtained using frequency ratios.},

This offers possibilities of constraining stellar core properties (such as core sizes, abundances, and physics) paving the way for improving the precision of the inferred stellar ages. We employ 16 Cyg A and B as our benchmark stars for an asteroseismic study in which we present a novel approach aimed at selecting from a sample of acceptable stellar models returned from forward modelling techniques, down to the ones that better represent the core of each star. This is accomplished by comparing specific properties of the observed frequency ratios for each star to the ones derived from the acceptable stellar models. We demonstrate that in this way we are able to constrain further the hydrogen mass fraction in the core, establishing the stars' precise evolutionary states and ages. The ranges of the derived core hydrogen mass fractions are [0.01-0.06] and [0.12-0.19] for 16 Cyg A and B, respectively, and, considering that the stars are coeval, the age and metal mass fraction parameters span the region [6.4-7.4] Gyr and [0.023-0.026], respectively. In addition, our findings show that using a single helium-to-heavy element enrichment ratio, ({$\Delta$}Y/{$\Delta$}Z), when forward modelling the 16 Cyg binary system, may result in a sample of acceptable models that do not simultaneously fit the observed frequency ratios, further highlighting that such an approach to the definition of the helium content of the star may not be adequate in studies of individual stars.},

It offers an important opportunity to check and develop our understanding of the physics and the evolution of solar-type stars. Aims: We present a spectroscopic study at high resolution, R {$\approx$} 50 000, of 14 stars located on the main sequence, at the turn-off point, and on the early subgiant branch in the cluster in order to investigate its detailed chemical composition, for comparison with the Sun and solar twins in the solar neighbourhood, and to explore selective atomic diffusion of chemical elements as predicted by stellar-structure theory. Methods: We have obtained VLT/FLAMES-UVES spectra and analysed these strictly differentially in order to explore chemical-abundance similarities and differences between the M 67 stars and the Sun and among the M 67 stars themselves. Results: Individual abundances of 19 different chemical elements are obtained for the stars. They are found to agree very well with solar abundances, with abundance ratios closer to solar than those of most solar twins in the solar neighbourhood. An exception is Li, which shows considerable scatter among the cluster stars. There is a tendency for the cluster-star abundances to be more depleted than the abundances in the field stars in correlation with the condensation temperature of the elements, a tendency also found earlier for the Sun. Moreover, the heavy-element abundances are found to be reduced in the hotter stars and dwarfs by typically {$\leq$}0.05 dex, as compared to the abundances of the subgiants. Conclusions: The results support the hypothesis that the gas of the proto-cluster was depleted by formation and cleansing of dust before the stars formed. They also add support to the proposal that the Sun was formed in a dense stellar environment. Moreover, the observed minor reductions of heavy elements, relative to our standard star M 67-1194 and the subgiants, in the atmospheres of dwarfs and turn-off point stars seem to suggest that diffusion processes are at work in these stars, although the evidence is not compelling. Based on theoretical models, the diffusion-corrected initial metallicity of M 67 is estimated to be [Fe/H] = +0.06. Appendix A is available in electronic form at http://www.aanda.org},

Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) is a suite of open source, robust, efficient, thread-safe libraries for a wide range of applications in computational stellar astrophysics. A one-dimensional stellar evolution module, MESAstar, combines many of the numerical and physics modules for simulations of a wide range of stellar evolution scenarios ranging from very low mass to massive stars, including advanced evolutionary phases. MESAstar solves the fully coupled structure and composition equations simultaneously. It uses adaptive mesh refinement and sophisticated timestep controls, and supports shared memory parallelism based on OpenMP. State-of-the-art modules provide equation of state, opacity, nuclear reaction rates, element diffusion data, and atmosphere boundary conditions. Each module is constructed as a separate Fortran 95 library with its own explicitly defined public interface to facilitate independent development. Several detailed examples indicate the extensive verification and testing that is continuously performed and demonstrate the wide range of capabilities that MESA possesses. These examples include evolutionary tracks of very low mass stars, brown dwarfs, and gas giant planets to very old ages; the complete evolutionary track of a 1 M sun star from the pre-main sequence (PMS) to a cooling white dwarf; the solar sound speed profile; the evolution of intermediate-mass stars through the He-core burning phase and thermal pulses on the He-shell burning asymptotic giant branch phase; the interior structure of slowly pulsating B Stars and Beta Cepheids; the complete evolutionary tracks of massive stars from the PMS to the onset of core collapse; mass transfer from stars undergoing Roche lobe overflow; and the evolution of helium accretion onto a neutron star.

Improvements in MESA star's ability to model the evolution of giant planets now extends its applicability down to masses as low as one-tenth that of Jupiter. The dramatic improvement in asteroseismology enabled by the space-based Kepler and CoRoT missions motivates our full coupling of the ADIPLS adiabatic pulsation code with MESA star. This also motivates a numerical recasting of the Ledoux criterion that is more easily implemented when many nuclei are present at non-negligible abundances. This impacts the way in which MESA star calculates semi-convective and thermohaline mixing. We exhibit the evolution of 3-8 M {$\odot$} stars through the end of core He burning, the onset of He thermal pulses, and arrival on the white dwarf cooling sequence. We implement diffusion of angular momentum and chemical abundances that enable calculations of rotating-star models, which we compare thoroughly with earlier work. We introduce a new treatment of radiation-dominated envelopes that allows the uninterrupted evolution of massive stars to core collapse. This enables the generation of new sets of supernovae, long gamma-ray burst, and pair-instability progenitor models. We substantially modify the way in which MESA star solves the fully coupled stellar structure and composition equations, and we show how this has improved the scaling of MESA's calculational speed on multi-core processors. Updates to the modules for equation of state, opacity, nuclear reaction rates, and atmospheric boundary conditions are also provided.

Implicit hydrodynamics with shocks can now be treated with MESA, enabling modeling of the entire massive star lifecycle, from pre-main-sequence evolution to the onset of core collapse and nucleosynthesis from the resulting explosion. Coupling of the GYRE non-adiabatic pulsation instrument with MESA allows for new explorations of the instability strips for massive stars while also accelerating the astrophysical use of asteroseismology data. We improve the treatment of mass accretion, giving more accurate and robust near-surface profiles. A new MESA capability to calculate weak reaction rates ``on-the-fly'' from input nuclear data allows better simulation of accretion induced collapse of massive white dwarfs and the fate of some massive stars. We discuss the ongoing challenge of chemical diffusion in the strongly coupled plasma regime, and exhibit improvements in MESA that now allow for the simulation of radiative levitation of heavy elements in hot stars.

  abstract = {Context. Increasing the number of detected exoplanets is far from anecdotal, especially for long-period planets that require a long duration of observation. More detections imply a better understanding of the statistical properties of exoplanet populations, and detailed modelling of their host stars also enables thorough discussions of star-planet interactions and orbital evolution of planetary systems. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Aims: In the context of the discovery of a new planetary system, we aim to perform a complete study of HD 29399 and its companion by means of radial-velocity measurements, seismic characterisation of the host-star, and modelling of the orbital evolution of the system. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Methods: High-resolution spectra of HD 29399 were acquired with the CORALIE spectrograph mounted on the 1.2-m Swiss telescope located at La Silla Observatory (Chile) as part of the CASCADES survey. We used the moments of the cross-correlation function profile as well as the photometric variability of the star as diagnostics to distinguish between stellar and planetary-induced signals. To model the host star we combined forward modelling with global and local minimisation approaches and inversion techniques. We also studied the orbital history of the system under the effects of both dynamical and equilibrium tides. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Results: We present the detection of a long-period giant planet. Combining these measurements with photometric observations by TESS, we are able to thoroughly model the host star and study the orbital evolution of the system. We derive stellar and planetary masses of 1.17 {$\pm$} 0.10 M\textsubscript{{$\odot$}} and 1.59 {$\pm$} 0.08 M\textsubscript{Jup}, respectively, and an age for the system of 6.2 Gyr. We show that neither dynamical nor equilibrium tides have been able to affect the orbital evolution of the planet. Moreover, no engulfment is predicted for the future evolution of the system. {$<$}P /{$>$}Based on observations collected with the CORALIE echelle spectrograph on the 1.2-m Euler Swiss telescope at La Silla Observatory, ESO, Chile.},

  abstract = {We present a catalog of revised effective temperatures for stars observed in long-cadence mode in the Kepler Input Catalog (KIC). We use Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) griz filters tied to the fundamental temperature scale. Polynomials for griz color-temperature relations are presented, along with correction terms for surface gravity effects, metallicity, and statistical corrections for binary companions or blending. We compare our temperature scale to the published infrared flux method (IRFM) scale for VTJKs in both open clusters and the Kepler fields. We find good agreement overall, with some deviations between (J - Ks )-based temperatures from the IRFM and both SDSS filter and other diagnostic IRFM color-temperature relationships above 6000 K. For field dwarfs, we find a mean shift toward hotter temperatures relative to the KIC, of order 215 K, in the regime where the IRFM scale is well defined (4000 K to 6500 K). This change is of comparable magnitude in both color systems and in spectroscopy for stars with T eff below 6000 K. Systematic differences between temperature estimators appear for hotter stars, and we define corrections to put the SDSS temperatures on the IRFM scale for them. When the theoretical dependence on gravity is accounted for, we find a similar temperature scale offset between the fundamental and KIC scales for giants. We demonstrate that statistical corrections to color-based temperatures from binaries are significant. Typical errors, mostly from uncertainties in extinction, are of order 100 K. Implications for other applications of the KIC are discussed.},

The spectroscopic parameters provided from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment project are complemented with asteroseismic surface gravities, masses, radii, and mean densities determined by members of the Kepler Asteroseismology Science Consortium. We assess both random and systematic sources of error and include a discussion of sample selection for giants in the Kepler fields. Total uncertainties in the main catalog properties are of the order of 80 K in T eff, 0.06 dex in [M/H], 0.014 dex in log g, and 12\% and 5\% in mass and radius, respectively; these reflect a combination of systematic and random errors. Asteroseismic surface gravities are substantially more precise and accurate than spectroscopic ones, and we find good agreement between their mean values and the calibrated spectroscopic surface gravities. There are, however, systematic underlying trends with T eff and log g. Our effective temperature scale is between 0 and 200 K cooler than that expected from the infrared flux method, depending on the adopted extinction map, which provides evidence for a lower value on average than that inferred for the Kepler Input Catalog (KIC). We find a reasonable correspondence between the photometric KIC and spectroscopic APOKASC metallicity scales, with increased dispersion in KIC metallicities as the absolute metal abundance decreases, and offsets in T eff and log g consistent with those derived in the literature. We present mean fitting relations between APOKASC and KIC observables and discuss future prospects, strengths, and limitations of the catalog data.},

Our data include evolutionary state, surface gravity, mean density, mass, radius, age, and the spectroscopic and asteroseismic measurements used to derive them. We employ a new empirical approach for combining asteroseismic measurements from different methods, calibrating the inferred stellar parameters, and estimating uncertainties. With high statistical significance, we find that asteroseismic parameters inferred from the different pipelines have systematic offsets that are not removed by accounting for differences in their solar reference values. We include theoretically motivated corrections to the large frequency spacing ({$\Delta\nu$}) scaling relation, and we calibrate the zero-point of the frequency of the maximum power ({$\nu$} max) relation to be consistent with masses and radii for members of star clusters. For most targets, the parameters returned by different pipelines are in much better agreement than would be expected from the pipeline-predicted random errors, but 22\% of them had at least one method not return a result and a much larger measurement dispersion. This supports the usage of multiple analysis techniques for asteroseismic stellar population studies. The measured dispersion in mass estimates for fundamental calibrators is consistent with our error model, which yields median random and systematic mass uncertainties for RGB stars of order 4\%. Median random and systematic mass uncertainties are at the 9\% and 8\% level, respectively, for red clump stars.},

  abstract = {Primordial nucleosynthesis is one of the three historical evidences for the big bang model, together with the expansion of the universe and the cosmic microwave background. There is a good global agreement between the computed primordial abundances of helium-4, deuterium, helium-3 and their values deduced from observations. Now that the number of neutrino families and the baryonic densities have been fixed by laboratory measurements or CMB observations, the model has no free parameter and its predictions are rigid. Since this is the earliest cosmic process for which we a priori know all the physics involved, departure from its predictions could provide hints or constraints on new physics or astrophysics in the early universe. Precision on primordial abundances deduced from observations has recently been drastically improved and reach the percent level for both deuterium and helium-4. Accordingly, the BBN predictions should reach the same level of precision. For most isotopes, the dominant sources of uncertainty come from those on the laboratory thermonuclear reactions. This article focuses on helium-4 whose predicted primordial abundance depends essentially on weak interactions which control the neutron-proton ratio. The rates of the various weak interaction processes depend on the experimentally measured neutron lifetime, but also includes numerous corrections that we thoroughly investigate here. They are the radiative, zero-temperature, corrections, finite nucleon mass corrections, finite temperature radiative corrections, weak-magnetism, and QED plasma effects, which are for the first time all included and calculated in a self consistent way, allowing to take into account the correlations between them, and verifying that all satisfy detailed balance. Finally, we include the incomplete neutrino decoupling and claim to reach a 10-4 accuracy on the helium-4 predicted mass fraction of 0 . 24709 {$\pm$} 0 . 00017 (when including the uncertainty on the neutron lifetime). In addition, we provide a Mathematica primordial nucleosynthesis code that incorporates, not only these corrections but also a full network of reactions, using the best available thermonuclear reaction rates, allowing the predictions of primordial abundances of helium-4, deuterium, helium-3 and lithium-7 but also of heavier isotopes up to the CNO region.}

  abstract = {This paper presents cosmological results based on full-mission Planck observations of temperature and polarization anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. Our results are in very good agreement with the 2013 analysis of the Planck nominal-mission temperature data, but with increased precision. The temperature and polarization power spectra are consistent with the standard spatially-flat 6-parameter {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology with a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations (denoted "base {$\Lambda$}CDM" in this paper). From the Planck temperature data combined with Planck lensing, for this cosmology we find a Hubble constant, H0 = (67.8 {$\pm$} 0.9) km s-1Mpc-1, a matter density parameter {$\Omega$}m = 0.308 {$\pm$} 0.012, and a tilted scalar spectral index with ns = 0.968 {$\pm$} 0.006, consistent with the 2013 analysis. Note that in this abstract we quote 68\% confidence limits on measured parameters and 95\% upper limits on other parameters. We present the first results of polarization measurements with the Low Frequency Instrument at large angular scales. Combined with the Planck temperature and lensing data, these measurements give a reionization optical depth of {$\tau$} = 0.066 {$\pm$} 0.016, corresponding to a reionization redshift of z\_re=8.8+1.7-1.4. These results are consistent with those from WMAP polarization measurements cleaned for dust emission using 353-GHz polarization maps from the High Frequency Instrument. We find no evidence for any departure from base {$\Lambda$}CDM in the neutrino sector of the theory; for example, combining Planck observations with other astrophysical data we find Neff = 3.15 {$\pm$} 0.23 for the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, consistent with the value Neff = 3.046 of the Standard Model of particle physics. The sum of neutrino masses is constrained to {$\sum$} m{$\nu$} {$<$} 0.23 eV. The spatial curvature of our Universe is found to be very close to zero, with | {$\Omega$}K | {$<$} 0.005. Adding a tensor component as a single-parameter extension to base {$\Lambda$}CDM we find an upper limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of r0.002{$<$} 0.11, consistent with the Planck 2013 results and consistent with the B-mode polarization constraints from a joint analysis of BICEP2, Keck Array, and Planck (BKP) data. Adding the BKP B-mode data to our analysis leads to a tighter constraint of r0.002 {$<$} 0.09 and disfavours inflationarymodels with a V({$\varphi$}) {$\propto$} {$\varphi$}2 potential. The addition of Planck polarization data leads to strong constraints on deviations from a purely adiabatic spectrum of fluctuations. We find no evidence for any contribution from isocurvature perturbations or from cosmic defects. Combining Planck data with other astrophysical data, including Type Ia supernovae, the equation of state of dark energy is constrained to w = -1.006 {$\pm$} 0.045, consistent with the expected value for a cosmological constant. The standard big bang nucleosynthesis predictions for the helium and deuterium abundances for the best-fit Planck base {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology are in excellent agreement with observations. We also constraints on annihilating dark matter and on possible deviations from the standard recombination history. In neither case do we find no evidence for new physics. The Planck results for base {$\Lambda$}CDM are in good agreement with baryon acoustic oscillation data and with the JLA sample of Type Ia supernovae. However, as in the 2013 analysis, the amplitude of the fluctuation spectrum is found to be higher than inferred from some analyses of rich cluster counts and weak gravitational lensing. We show that these tensions cannot easily be resolved with simple modifications of the base {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology. Apart from these tensions, the base {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology provides an excellent description of the Planck CMB observations and many other astrophysical data sets.},

  abstract = {A momentum term is usually included in the simulations of connectionist learning algorithms. Although it is well known that such a term greatly improves the speed of learning, there have been few rigorous studies of its mechanisms. In this paper, I show that in the limit of continuous time, the momentum parameter is analogous to the mass of Newtonian particles that move through a viscous medium in a conservative force field. The behavior of the system near a local minimum is equivalent to a set of coupled and damped harmonic oscillators. The momentum term improves the speed of convergence by bringing some eigen components of the system closer to critical damping. Similar results can be obtained for the discrete time case used in computer simulations. In particular, I derive the bounds for convergence on learning-rate and momentum parameters, and demonstrate that the momentum term can increase the range of learning rate over which the system converges. The optimal condition for convergence is also analyzed.},

Currently, the most successful and widely-used activation function is the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU). Although various hand-designed alternatives to ReLU have been proposed, none have managed to replace it due to inconsistent gains. In this work, we propose to leverage automatic search techniques to discover new activation functions. Using a combination of exhaustive and reinforcement learning-based search, we discover multiple novel activation functions. We verify the effectiveness of the searches by conducting an empirical evaluation with the best discovered activation function. Our experiments show that the best discovered activation function, \$f(x) = x \textbackslash cdot \textbackslash text\{sigmoid\}(\textbackslash beta x)\$, which we name Swish, tends to work better than ReLU on deeper models across a number of challenging datasets. For example, simply replacing ReLUs with Swish units improves top-1 classification accuracy on ImageNet by 0.9\textbackslash\% for Mobile NASNet-A and 0.6\textbackslash\% for Inception-ResNet-v2. The simplicity of Swish and its similarity to ReLU make it easy for practitioners to replace ReLUs with Swish units in any neural network.},

  abstract = {PLATO 2.0 has recently been selected for ESA's M3 launch opportunity (2022/24). Providing accurate key planet parameters (radius, mass, density and age) in statistical numbers, it addresses fundamental questions such as: How do planetary systems form and evolve? Are there other systems with planets like ours, including potentially habitable planets? The PLATO 2.0 instrument consists of 34 small aperture telescopes (32 with 25 s readout cadence and 2 with 2.5 s candence) providing a wide field-of-view (2232 deg 2) and a large photometric magnitude range (4-16 mag). It focusses on bright (4-11 mag) stars in wide fields to detect and characterize planets down to Earth-size by photometric transits, whose masses can then be determined by ground-based radial-velocity follow-up measurements. Asteroseismology will be performed for these bright stars to obtain highly accurate stellar parameters, including masses and ages. The combination of bright targets and asteroseismology results in high accuracy for the bulk planet parameters: 2 \%, 4-10 \% and 10 \% for planet radii, masses and ages, respectively. The planned baseline observing strategy includes two long pointings (2-3 years) to detect and bulk characterize planets reaching into the habitable zone (HZ) of solar-like stars and an additional step-and-stare phase to cover in total about 50 \% of the sky. PLATO 2.0 will observe up to 1,000,000 stars and detect and characterize hundreds of small planets, and thousands of planets in the Neptune to gas giant regime out to the HZ. It will therefore provide the first large-scale catalogue of bulk characterized planets with accurate radii, masses, mean densities and ages. This catalogue will include terrestrial planets at intermediate orbital distances, where surface temperatures are moderate. Coverage of this parameter range with statistical numbers of bulk characterized planets is unique to PLATO 2.0. The PLATO 2.0 catalogue allows us to e.g.: - complete our knowledge of planet diversity for low-mass objects, - correlate the planet mean density-orbital distance distribution with predictions from planet formation theories,- constrain the influence of planet migration and scattering on the architecture of multiple systems, and - specify how planet and system parameters change with host star characteristics, such as type, metallicity and age. The catalogue will allow us to study planets and planetary systems at different evolutionary phases. It will further provide a census for small, low-mass planets. This will serve to identify objects which retained their primordial hydrogen atmosphere and in general the typical characteristics of planets in such low-mass, low-density range. Planets detected by PLATO 2.0 will orbit bright stars and many of them will be targets for future atmosphere spectroscopy exploring their atmosphere. Furthermore, the mission has the potential to detect exomoons, planetary rings, binary and Trojan planets. The planetary science possible with PLATO 2.0 is complemented by its impact on stellar and galactic science via asteroseismology as well as light curves of all kinds of variable stars, together with observations of stellar clusters of different ages. This will allow us to improve stellar models and study stellar activity. A large number of well-known ages from red giant stars will probe the structure and evolution of our Galaxy. Asteroseismic ages of bright stars for different phases of stellar evolution allow calibrating stellar age-rotation relationships. Together with the results of ESA's Gaia mission, the results of PLATO 2.0 will provide a huge legacy to planetary, stellar and galactic science.},

  abstract = {Context. Detailed oscillation spectra comprising individual frequencies  for numerous solar-type stars and red giants are either currently available, e.g. courtesy of the CoRoT, Kepler, and K2 missions, or will become available with the upcoming NASA TESS and ESA PLATO 2.0 missions. The data can lead to a precise characterisation of these stars thereby improving our understanding of stellar evolution, exoplanetary systems, and the history of our galaxy. Aims: Our goal is to test and compare different methods for obtaining stellar properties from oscillation frequencies and spectroscopic constraints. Specifically, we would like to evaluate the accuracy of the results and reliability of the associated error bars, and to see where there is room for improvement. Methods: In the context of the SpaceInn network, we carried out a hare-and-hounds exercise in which one group, the hares, simulated observations of oscillation spectra for a set of ten artificial solar-type stars, and a number of hounds applied various methods for characterising these stars based on the data produced by the hares. Most of the hounds fell into two main groups. The first group used forward modelling (I.e. applied various search/optimisation algorithms in a stellar parameter space) whereas the second group relied on acoustic glitch signatures. Results: Results based on the forward modelling approach were accurate to 1.5\% (radius), 3.9\% (mass), 23\% (age), 1.5\% (surface gravity), and 1.8\% (mean density), as based on the root mean square difference. Individual hounds reached different degrees of accuracy, some of which were substantially better than the above average values. For the two 1M{$\odot$} stellar targets, the accuracy on the age is better than 10\% thereby satisfying the requirements for the PLATO 2.0 mission. High stellar masses and atomic diffusion (which in our models does not include the effects of radiative accelerations) proved to be sources of difficulty. The average accuracies for the acoustic radii of the base of the convection zone, the He II ionisation, and the {$\Gamma$}1 peak located between the two He ionisation zones were 17\%, 2.4\%, and 1.9\%, respectively. The results from the forward modelling were on average more accurate than those from the glitch fitting analysis as the latter seemed to be affected by aliasing problems for some of the targets.  Conclusions: Our study indicates that forward modelling is the most accurate way of interpreting the pulsation spectra of solar-type stars. However, given its model-dependent nature, this method needs to be complemented by model-independent results from, e.g. glitch analysis. Furthermore, our results indicate that global rather than local optimisation algorithms should be used in order to obtain robust error bars.},

  abstract = {The chemical enrichment law Y(Z) is studied by using detached  double-lined eclipsing binaries with accurate absolute dimensions and effective temperatures. A sample of 50 suitable systems was collected from the literature, and their effective temperatures were carefully re-determined. The chemical composition of each of the systems was obtained by comparison with stellar evolutionary models, under the assumption that they should fit an isochrone to the observed properties of the components. Evolutionary models covering a wide grid in Z and Y were adopted for our study. An algorithm was developed for searching the best-fitting chemical composition (and the age) for the systems, based on the minimization of a {$\chi$}2 function. The errors (and biases) of these parameters were estimated by means of Monte Carlo simulations, with special care put on the correlations existing between the errors of both components. In order to check the physical consistency of the results, we compared our metallicity values with empirical determinations, obtaining excellent coherence. The independently derived Z and Y values yielded a determination of the chemical enrichment law via weighted linear least-squares fit. Our value of the slope, {$\Delta$}Y/{$\Delta$}Z=2.2+/-0.8, is in good agreement with recent results, but it has a smaller formal error and it is free of systematic effects. Linear extrapolation of the enrichment law to zero metals leads to an estimation of the primordial helium abundance of Yp=0.225+/-0.013, possibly affected by systematics in the effective temperature determination.},

TESS has been selected by NASA for launch in 2017 as an Astrophysics Explorer mission. The spacecraft will be placed into a highly elliptical 13.7-day orbit around the Earth. During its 2-year mission, TESS will employ four wide-field optical charge-coupled device cameras to monitor at least 200,000 main-sequence dwarf stars with IC{$\approx$}4-13 for temporary drops in brightness caused by planetary transits. Each star will be observed for an interval ranging from 1 month to 1 year, depending mainly on the star's ecliptic latitude. The longest observing intervals will be for stars near the ecliptic poles, which are the optimal locations for follow-up observations with the James Webb Space Telescope. Brightness measurements of preselected target stars will be recorded every 2 min, and full frame images will be recorded every 30 min. TESS stars will be 10 to 100 times brighter than those surveyed by the pioneering Kepler mission. This will make TESS planets easier to characterize with follow-up observations. TESS is expected to find more than a thousand planets smaller than Neptune, including dozens that are comparable in size to the Earth. Public data releases will occur every 4 months, inviting immediate community-wide efforts to study the new planets. The TESS legacy will be a catalog of the nearest and brightest stars hosting transiting planets, which will endure as highly favorable targets for detailed investigations.}

These bright Cepheids were observed with the WFC3 spatial scanning mode in the optical and near-infrared to mitigate saturation and reduce pixel-to-pixel calibration errors to reach a mean photometric error of 5 mmag per observation. We use the new Gaia DR2 parallaxes and HST photometry to simultaneously constrain the cosmic distance scale and to measure the DR2 parallax zeropoint offset appropriate for Cepheids. We find the latter to be -46 {$\pm$} 13 {$\mu$}as or {$\pm$}6 {$\mu$}as for a fixed distance scale, higher than found from quasars, as expected for these brighter and redder sources. The precision of the distance scale from DR2 has been reduced by a factor of 2.5 because of the need to independently determine the parallax offset. The best-fit distance scale is 1.006 {$\pm$} 0.033, relative to the scale from Riess et al. with H 0 = 73.24 km s-1 Mpc-1 used to predict the parallaxes photometrically, and is inconsistent with the scale needed to match the Planck 2016 cosmic microwave background data combined with {$\Lambda$}CDM at the 2.9{$\sigma$} confidence level (99.6\%). At 96.5\% confidence we find that the formal DR2 errors may be underestimated as indicated. We identify additional errors associated with the use of augmented Cepheid samples utilizing ground-based photometry and discuss their likely origins. Including the DR2 parallaxes with all prior distance-ladder data raises the current tension between the late and early universe route to the Hubble constant to 3.8{$\sigma$} (99.99\%). With the final expected precision from Gaia, the sample of 50 Cepheids with HST photometry will limit to 0.5\% the contribution of the first rung of the distance ladder to the uncertainty in H 0.},

The results of an extensive Kepler follow-up program including multiple Doppler measurements for 22 planet-hosting stars more than doubles the population of sub-Neptune-sized transiting planets that have RV mass constraints. This unprecedentedly large and homogeneous sample of planets with both mass and radius constraints opens the possibility of a statistical study of the underlying population of planet compositions. We focus on the intriguing transition between rocky exoplanets (comprised of iron and silicates) and planets with voluminous layers of volatiles (H/He and astrophysical ices). Applying a hierarchical Bayesian statistical approach to the sample of Kepler transiting sub-Neptune planets with Keck RV follow-up, we constrain the fraction of close-in planets (with orbital periods less than {$\sim$}50 days) that are sufficiently dense to be rocky, as a function of planet radius. We show that the majority of 1.6 \{\{R\}\textbackslash oplus \} planets have too low density to be comprised of Fe and silicates alone. At larger radii, the constraints on the fraction of rocky planets are even more stringent. These insights into the size demographics of rocky and volatile-rich planets offer empirical constraints to planet formation theories, and guide the range of planet radii to be considered in studies of the occurrence rate of ``Earth-like'' planets, \{\{{$\eta$} \}\textbackslash oplus \}.},

After a long and deep minimum at the end of Cycle 23, the weaker activity of Cycle 24 contrasts with the previous cycles. In this work, the response of the solar acoustic oscillations to solar activity is used in order to provide insights into the structural and magnetic changes in the sub-surface layers of the Sun during this on-going unusual period of low activity. We analyze 18 yr of continuous observations of the solar acoustic oscillations collected by the Sun-as-a-star GOLF instrument on board the SoHO spacecraft. From the fitted mode frequencies, the temporal variability of the frequency shifts of the radial, dipolar, and quadrupolar modes are studied for different frequency ranges that are sensitive to different layers in the solar sub-surface interior. The low-frequency modes show nearly unchanged frequency shifts between Cycles 23 and 24, with a time evolving signature of the quasi-biennial oscillation, which is particularly visible for the quadrupole component revealing the presence of a complex magnetic structure. The modes at higher frequencies show frequency shifts that are 30\% smaller during Cycle 24, which is in agreement with the decrease observed in the surface activity between Cycles 23 and 24. The analysis of 18 yr of GOLF oscillations indicates that the structural and magnetic changes responsible for the frequency shifts remained comparable between Cycle 23 and Cycle 24 in the deeper sub-surface layers below 1400 km as revealed by the low-frequency modes. The frequency shifts of the higher-frequency modes, sensitive to shallower regions, show that Cycle 24 is magnetically weaker in the upper layers of Sun. {$<$}P /{$>$}Appendices are available in electronic form at {$<$}A href="http://www.aanda.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201425236/olm"{$>$}http://www.aanda.org{$<$}/A{$>$}The following 68 GOLF frequency tables are available and Table A.1 is also available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to {$<$}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr"{$>$}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr{$<$}/A{$>$} (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via {$<$}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/578/A137"{$>$}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/578/A137{$<$}/A{$>$}},

This class of MCMC, known as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, requires gradient information which is often not readily available. PyMC3 is a new open source probabilistic programming framework written in Python that uses Theano to compute gradients via automatic differentiation as well as compile probabilistic programs on-the-fly to C for increased speed. Contrary to other probabilistic programming languages, PyMC3 allows model specification directly in Python code. The lack of a domain specific language allows for great flexibility and direct interaction with the model. This paper is a tutorial-style introduction to this software package.},

We identify a complete sample of 44 red clump stars in the cluster, and have measured asteroseismic quantities ({$\nu$}max and/or {$\Delta\nu$}) for 29 of them. Five stars showed suppressed dipole modes, and the occurrence rates indicate that mode suppression is unaffected by evolution through core helium burning. A subset of the giants in NGC 1817 (and in the similarly aged cluster NGC 6811) have {$\nu$}max and {$\Delta\nu$} values at or near the maximum observed for core helium-burning stars, indicating they have core masses near the minimum for fully nondegenerate helium ignition. Further asteroseismic study of these stars can constrain the minimum helium core mass in red clump stars and the physics that determines this limit. Two giant stars show photometric variations on timescales similar to previously measured spectroscopic orbits. Thirteen systems in the field show eclipses, but only five are probable cluster members. We identify 32 {$\delta$} Sct pulsators, 27 {$\gamma$} Dor candidates, and 7 hybrids that are probable cluster members, with most being new detections. We used the ensemble properties of the {$\delta$} Sct stars to identify stars with possible radial pulsation modes. Among the oddities we have uncovered are: an eccentric orbit for a short-period binary containing a {$\delta$} Sct pulsating star; a rare subgiant within the Hertzsprung gap showing {$\delta$} Sct pulsations; and two hot {$\gamma$} Dor pulsating star candidates.},

This paper does not introduce a new detection technique, but instead studies the reliability and efficiency of detection with the most commonly used technique, the periodogram, in the case where the observation times are unevenly spaced. This choice was made because, of the methods in current use, it appears to have the simplest statistical behavior. A modification of the classical definition of the periodogram is necessary in order to retain the simple statistical behavior of the evenly spaced case. With this modification, periodogram analysis and least-squares fitting of sine waves to the data are exactly equivalent. Certain difficulties with the use of the periodogram are less important than commonly believed in the case of detection of strictly periodic signals. In addition, the standard method for mitigating these difficulties (tapering) can be used just as well if the sampling is uneven. An analysis of the statistical significance of signal detections is presented, with examples},

  abstract = {The chemical composition of the Sun is an essential piece of reference  data for astronomy, cosmology, astroparticle, space and geo-physics: elemental abundances of essentially all astronomical objects are referenced to the solar composition, and basically every process involving the Sun depends on its composition. This article, dealing with the intermediate-mass elements Na to Ca, is the first in a series describing the comprehensive re-determination of the solar composition. In this series we severely scrutinise all ingredients of the analysis across all elements, to obtain the most accurate, homogeneous and reliable results possible. We employ a highly realistic 3D hydrodynamic model of the solar photosphere, which has successfully passed an arsenal of observational diagnostics. For comparison, and to quantify remaining systematic errors, we repeat the analysis using three different 1D hydrostatic model atmospheres (marcs, miss and Holweger \& M\"uller 1974, Sol. Phys., 39, 19) and a horizontally and temporally-averaged version of the 3D model ({$\langle$} 3D {$\rangle$}). We account for departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) wherever possible. We have scoured the literature for the best possible input data, carefully assessing transition probabilities, hyperfine splitting, partition functions and other data for inclusion in the analysis. We have put the lines we use through a very stringent quality check in terms of their observed profiles and atomic data, and discarded all that we suspect to be blended. Our final recommended 3D+NLTE abundances are: log {$\varepsilon$}Na = 6.21 {$\pm$} 0.04, log {$\varepsilon$}Mg = 7.59 {$\pm$} 0.04, log {$\varepsilon$}Al = 6.43 {$\pm$} 0.04, log {$\varepsilon$}Si = 7.51 {$\pm$} 0.03, log {$\varepsilon$}P = 5.41 {$\pm$} 0.03, log {$\varepsilon$}S = 7.13 {$\pm$} 0.03, log {$\varepsilon$}K = 5.04 {$\pm$} 0.05 and log {$\varepsilon$}Ca = 6.32 {$\pm$} 0.03. The uncertainties include both statistical and systematic errors. Our results are systematically smaller than most previous ones with the 1D semi-empirical Holweger \& M\"uller model, whereas the {$\langle$} 3D {$\rangle$} model returns abundances very similar to the full 3D calculations. This analysis provides a complete description and a slight update of the results presented in Asplund et al. (2009, ARA\&A, 47, 481) for Na to Ca, and includes full details of all lines and input data used. Tables 1-4 and Appendix A are available in electronic form at http://www.aanda.org},

The latter work predicts a larger (\textasciitilde 10\%) solar metallicity compared to previous measurements by the same authors but significantly lower (\textasciitilde 25\%) than the recommended value from a decade ago by Grevesse \& Sauval. We compare the results of our models with determinations of the solar structure inferred through helioseismology measurements. The model that uses the most recent solar abundance determinations predicts the base of the solar convective envelope to be located at R CZ = 0.724 R sun and a surface helium mass fraction of Y surf = 0.231. These results are in conflict with helioseismology data (R CZ = 0.713 {$\pm$} 0.001 R sun and Y surf = 0.2485 {$\pm$} 0.0035) at 5{$\sigma$} and 11{$\sigma$} levels, respectively. Using the new solar abundances, we calculate the magnitude by which radiative opacities should be modified in order to restore agreement with helioseismology. We find that a maximum change of \textasciitilde 15\% at the base of the convective zone is required with a smooth decrease toward the core, where the change needed is \textasciitilde 5\%. The required change at the base of the convective envelope is about half the value estimated previously. We also present the solar neutrino fluxes predicted by the new models. The most important changes brought about by the new solar abundances are the increase by \textasciitilde 10\% in the predicted 13N and 15O fluxes that arise mostly due to the increase in the C and N abundances in the newly determined solar composition.},

We do so by using reference standard solar models (SSMs) to compute the power-law coefficients of the dependence of Y ini and Y surf on the input parameters. We use these dependencies to determine the correlation between Y ini and Y surf and use this correlation to eliminate uncertainties in Y ini from all solar model input parameters except the microscopic diffusion rate. We find an expression for Y ini that depends only on Y surf and the diffusion rate. By adopting the helioseismic determination of solar surface helium abundance, Y surf sun = 0.2485 {$\pm$} 0.0035, and an uncertainty of 20\% for the diffusion rate, we find that the initial solar helium abundance, Y ini sun, is 0.278 {$\pm$} 0.006 independently of the reference SSMs (and particularly on the adopted solar abundances) used in the derivation of the correlation between Y ini and Y surf. When non-SSMs with extra mixing are used, then we derive Y ini sun = 0.273 {$\pm$} 0.006. In both cases, the derived Y ini sun value is higher than that directly derived from solar model calibrations when the low-metallicity solar abundances (e.g., by Asplund et al.) are adopted in the models.},

Asteroseismic data for our sample of 415 objects have been obtained by the Kepler mission in short (58.5 s) cadence, and light curves span from 30 up to more than 1000 days. The spectroscopic parameters are based on spectra taken as part of the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment and correspond to Data Release 13 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We analyze our data using two independent \{T\}\{eff\} scales, the spectroscopic values from DR13 and those derived from SDSS griz photometry. We use the differences in our results arising from these choices as a test of systematic temperature uncertainties and find that they can lead to significant differences in the derived stellar properties. Determinations of surface gravity (\{log\}g), mean density ({$<$} {$\rho$} {$>$} ), radius (R), mass (M), and age ({$\tau$}) for the whole sample have been carried out by means of (stellar) grid-based modeling. We have thoroughly assessed random and systematic error sources in the spectroscopic and asteroseismic data, as well as in the grid-based modeling determination of the stellar quantities provided in the catalog. We provide stellar properties determined for each of the two \{T\}\{eff\} scales. The median combined (random and systematic) uncertainties are 2\% (0.01 dex; \{log\}g), 3.4\% ({$<$} {$\rho$} {$>$} ), 2.6\% (R), 5.1\% (M), and 19\% ({$\tau$}) for the photometric \{T\}\{eff\} scale and 2\% (\{log\}g), 3.5\% ({$<$} {$\rho$} {$>$} ), 2.7\% (R), 6.3\% (M), and 23\% ({$\tau$}) for the spectroscopic scale. We present comparisons with stellar quantities in the asteroseismic catalog by Chaplin et al. that highlight the importance of having metallicity measurements for determining stellar parameters accurately. Finally, we compare our results with those coming from a variety of sources, including stellar radii determined from TGAS parallaxes and asteroseismic analyses based on individual frequencies. We find a very good agreement for all inferred quantities. The latter comparison, in particular, gives strong support to the determination of stellar quantities based on global seismology, a relevant result for future missions such as TESS and PLATO.},

Our methods are based on Bayesian hierarchical modelling that is known to produce parameter estimators for the individual objects that are on average closer to their true values than estimators based on case-by-case analyses. We verify this in the context of estimating ages of Galactic halo white dwarfs (WDs) via a series of simulation studies. Finally, we deploy our new techniques on optical and near-infrared photometry of 10 candidate halo WDs to obtain estimates of their ages along with an estimate of the mean age of Galactic halo WDs of 12.11\_\{-0.86\}\^\{+0.85\} Gyr.

We implement a new Bayesian scheme that is flexible in its input to process individual oscillation frequencies, combinations of them, and average asteroseismic parameters, and derive robust fundamental properties for these targets. Applying this scheme to grids of evolutionary models yields stellar properties with median statistical uncertainties of 1.2 per cent (radius), 1.7 per cent (density), 3.3 per cent (mass), 4.4 per cent (distance), and 14 per cent (age), making this the exoplanet host-star sample with the most precise and uniformly determined fundamental parameters to date. We assess the systematics from changes in the solar abundances and mixing-length parameter, showing that they are smaller than the statistical errors. We also determine the stellar properties with three other fitting algorithms and explore the systematics arising from using different evolution and pulsation codes, resulting in 1 per cent in density and radius, and 2 per cent and 7 per cent in mass and age, respectively. We confirm previous findings of the initial helium abundance being a source of systematics comparable to our statistical uncertainties, and discuss future prospects for constraining this parameter by combining asteroseismology and data from space missions. Finally, we compare our derived properties with those obtained using the global average asteroseismic observables along with effective temperature and metallicity, finding excellent level of agreement. Owing to selection effects, our results show that the majority of the high signal-to-noise ratio asteroseismic Kepler host stars are older than the Sun.},

Comparisons among the different results reveal a good level of agreement in all stellar properties, which is remarkable considering the variety of codes, input physics, and analysis methods employed by the different teams.

These errors, which include discontinuities, outliers, systematic trends, and other instrumental signatures, obscure astrophysical signals. The presearch data conditioning (PDC) module of the Kepler data analysis pipeline tries to remove these errors while preserving planet transits and other astrophysically interesting signals. The completely new noise and stellar variability regime observed in Kepler data poses a significant problem to standard cotrending methods. Variable stars are often of particular astrophysical interest, so the preservation of their signals is of significant importance to the astrophysical community. We present a Bayesian maximum a posteriori (MAP) approach, where a subset of highly correlated and quiet stars is used to generate a cotrending basis vector set, which is in turn used to establish a range of ``reasonable'' robust fit parameters. These robust fit parameters are then used to generate a Bayesian prior and a Bayesian posterior probability distribution function (PDF) which, when maximized, finds the best fit that simultaneously removes systematic effects while reducing the signal distortion and noise injection that commonly afflicts simple least-squares (LS) fitting. A numerical and empirical approach is taken where the Bayesian prior PDFs are generated from fits to the light-curve distributions themselves.}

This review presents a summary of the available techniques for age-dating stars and ensembles of stars, their realms of applicability, and their strengths and weaknesses. My emphasis is on low-mass stars because they are present from all epochs of star formation in the Galaxy and because they present both special opportunities and problems. The ages of open clusters are important for understanding the limitations of stellar models and for calibrating empirical age indicators. For individual stars, a hierarchy of quality for the available age-dating methods is described. Although our present ability to determine the ages of even the nearest stars is mediocre, the next few years hold great promise as asteroseismology probes beyond stellar surfaces and starts to provide precise interior properties of stars and as models continue to improve when stressed by better observations.},

  abstract = {Context. The CoRoT and Kepler space-borne missions have provided us with  a wealth of high-quality observational data that allows for seismic inferences of stellar interiors. This requires the computation of precise and accurate theoretical frequencies, but imperfect modeling of the uppermost stellar layers introduces systematic errors. To overcome this problem, an empirical correction has been introduced by Kjeldsen et al. (2008, ApJ, 683, L175) and is now commonly used for seismic inferences. Nevertheless, we still lack a physical justification allowing for the quantification of the surface-effect corrections. Aims: Our aim is to constrain the surface-effect corrections across the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram using a set of 3D hydrodynamical simulations. Methods: We used a grid of these simulations computed with the CO5BOLD code to model the outer layers of solar-like stars. Upper layers of the corresponding 1D standard models were then replaced by the layers obtained from the horizontally averaged 3D models. The frequency differences between these patched models and the 1D standard models were then calculated using the adiabatic approximation and allowed us to constrain the Kjeldsen et al. power law, as well as a Lorentzian formulation. Results: We find that the surface effects on modal frequencies depend significantly on both the effective temperature and the surface gravity. We further provide the variation in the parameters related to the surface-effect corrections using their power law as well as a Lorentzian formulation. Scaling relations between these parameters and the elevation (related to the Mach number) is also provided. The Lorentzian formulation is shown to be more robust for the whole frequency spectrum, while the power law is not suitable for the frequency shifts in the frequency range above {$\nu$}max. Finally, we show that, owing to turbulent pressure, the elevation of the uppermost layers modifies the location of the hydrogen ionization zone and consequently introduces glitches in the surface effects for models with high (low) effective temperature (surface gravity).  Conclusions: Surface-effect corrections vary significantly across the HR diagram. Therefore, empirical relations like those by Kjeldsen et al. must not be calibrated on the Sun but should instead be constrained using realistic physical modeling as provided by 3D hydrodynamical simulations.},

  abstract = {We assess the systematic uncertainties in stellar evolutionary  calculations for low- to intermediate-mass, main-sequence stars. We compare published stellar tracks from several different evolution codes with our own tracks computed using the stellar codes stars and mesa. In particular, we focus on tracks of 1 and 3 M{$\odot$} at solar metallicity. We find that the spread in the available 1 M{$\odot$} tracks (computed before the recent solar composition revision) can be covered by tracks between 0.97-1.01 M{$\odot$} computed with the stars code. We assess some possible causes of the origin of this uncertainty, including how the choice of input physics and the solar constraints used to perform the solar calibration affect the tracks. We find that for a 1 M{$\odot$} track, uncertainties of around 10\% in the initial hydrogen abundance and initial metallicity produce around a 2\% error in mass. For the 3 M{$\odot$} tracks, there is very little difference between the tracks from the various different stellar codes. The main difference comes in the extent of the main sequence, which we believe results from the different choices of the implementation of convective overshooting in the core. Uncertainties in the initial abundances lead to a 1-2\% error in the mass determination. These uncertainties cover only part of the total error budget, which should also include uncertainties in the input physics (e.g., reaction rates, opacities, convective models) and any missing physics (e.g., radiative levitation, rotation, magnetic fields). Uncertainties in stellar surface properties such as luminosity and effective temperature will further reduce the accuracy of any potential mass determinations.},

Split across faculty scientists, postdoctoral researchers and PhD students, this averages to {$\greaterequivlnt$}37 tCO2e yr-1 per astronomer, more than 40\% greater than the average Australian non-dependant's emissions in total, and equivalent to around five times the global average. To combat these environmentally unsustainable practices, we suggest that astronomers should strongly preference the use of supercomputers, observatories and office spaces that are predominantly powered by renewable energy sources. Where current facilities do not meet this requirement, their funders should be lobbied to invest in renewables, such as solar or wind farms. Air travel should also be reduced wherever possible, replaced primarily by video conferencing, which should also promote inclusivity.},

These errors, which include discontinuities, systematic trends, and outliers, obscure the astrophysical signals in the light curves. To correct these errors is the task of the Presearch Data Conditioning (PDC) module of the Kepler data analysis pipeline. The original version of PDC in Kepler did not meet the extremely high performance requirements for the detection of miniscule planet transits or highly accurate analysis of stellar activity and rotation. One particular deficiency was that astrophysical features were often removed as a side effect of the removal of errors. In this article we introduce the completely new and significantly improved version of PDC which was implemented in Kepler SOC version 8.0. This new PDC version, which utilizes a Bayesian approach for removal of systematics, reliably corrects errors in the light curves while at the same time preserving planet transits and other astrophysically interesting signals. We describe the architecture and the algorithms of this new PDC module, show typical errors encountered in Kepler data, and illustrate the corrections using real light curve examples.}

In this paper, we show that when stochastic gradient descent with momentum uses a well-designed random initialization and a particular type of slowly increasing schedule for the momentum parameter, it can train both DNNs and RNNs (on datasets with long-term dependencies) to levels of performance that were previously achievable only with Hessian-Free optimization. We find that both the initialization and the momentum are crucial since poorly initialized networks cannot be trained with momentum and well-initialized networks perform markedly worse when the momentum is absent or poorly tuned. Our success training these models suggests that previous attempts to train deep and recurrent neural networks from random initializations have likely failed due to poor initialization schemes. Furthermore, carefully tuned momentum methods suffice for dealing with the curvature issues in deep and recurrent network training objectives without the need for sophisticated second-order methods.}

The advent of Gaia and large spectroscopic surveys has now made it in principle possible to infer properties of individual stars, including most exoplanet hosts, to very high precision. However, we show that in practice, such analyses are limited both by uncertainties in the fundamental scale, and by uncertainties in our models of stellar evolution, even for stars similar to the Sun. For example, we show that current uncertainties on measured interferometric angular diameters and bolometric fluxes set a systematic uncertainty floor of \$\textbackslash sim\$2\% in temperature, \$\textbackslash sim\$2\% in luminosity, and \$\textbackslash sim\$4\% in radius. Comparisons between widely available model grids suggest uncertainties of order \$\textbackslash sim\$5\% in mass and \$\textbackslash sim\$20\% in age for main sequence and subgiant stars. While the radius uncertainties are roughly constant over this range of stars, the model dependent uncertainties are a complex function of luminosity, temperature, and metallicity. We provide open-source software for approximating these uncertainties for individual targets, and discuss strategies for reducing these uncertainties in the future.},

Given the size and accuracy of this sample, these data offer an unprecedented test of the accuracy of stellar models on the post-main-sequence. When we compare these data to theoretical predictions, we find a metallicity dependent temperature offset with a slope of around 100 K per dex in metallicity. We find that this effect is present in all model grids tested, and that theoretical uncertainties in the models, correlated spectroscopic errors, and shifts in the asteroseismic mass scale are insufficient to explain this effect. Stellar models can be brought into agreement with the data if a metallicity-dependent convective mixing length is used, with {$\Delta\alpha$} ML,YREC {$\sim$} 0.2 per dex in metallicity, a trend inconsistent with the predictions of three-dimensional stellar convection simulations. If this effect is not taken into account, isochrone ages for red giants from the Gaia data will be off by as much as a factor of two even at modest deviations from solar metallicity ([Fe/H] = -0.5).},

As such, time-domain surveys such as Kepler, K2, and TESS will continue to play a critical role as the first step in identifying candidate exomoon systems, which may then be followed up with premier ground- or space-based telescopes. In this work, we train an ensemble of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to identify candidate exomoon signals in single-transit events observed by Kepler. Our training set consists of \textasciitilde 27 000 examples of synthetic, planet-only, and planet + moon single transits, injected into Kepler light curves. We achieve up to 88 per cent classification accuracy with individual CNN architectures and 97 per cent precision in identifying the moons in the validation set when the CNN ensemble is in total agreement. We then apply the CNN ensemble to light curves from 1880 Kepler Objects of Interest with periods {$>$}10 d (\textasciitilde 57 000 individual transits), and further test the accuracy of the CNN classifier by injecting planet transits into each light curve, thus quantifying the extent to which residual stellar activity may result in false positive classifications. We find a small fraction of these transits contain moon-like signals, though we caution against strong inferences of the exomoon occurrence rate from this result. We conclude by discussing some ongoing challenges to utilizing neural networks for the exomoon search.},

We give improved diffusion velocities for hydrogen, helium, oxygen, and iron, in the analytic form derived previously by Bachall \& Loeb. These expressions for the diffusion velocities are simple to program in stellar evolution codes and are expected to be accurate to approximately 15\%. We find that the inclusion of the residual heat flow terms leads to an increase in the hydrogen diffusion velocity. We compare our numerical results with those obtained analytically by Bachall \& Loeb using a simplified treatment, as well as with those derived numerically by Michaud \& Proffitt. We find that for conditions characteristic of the Sun, the results of Bachall \& Loeb for the hydrogen diffusion velocity are smaller than our more accurate numerical results by approximately 30\%, except very near the center where the error becomes larger. The Michaud \& Proffitt results differ from the numerical results derived here by less than or = 15\%. Our complete treatment of element diffusion can be directly incorporated in a standard stellar evolution code by means of an exportable subroutine, but, for convenience, we also give simple analytical fits to our numerical results.},

The availability of high-quality astero-seismological data  provided by satellite missions stimulated the development of several grid-based estimation techniques to determine the stellar masses and radii. Some aspects of the systematic and statistical errors affecting these techniques have still not been investigated well. Aims: We study the impact on mass and radius determination of the uncertainty in the input physics, in the mixing-length value, in the initial helium abundance, and in the microscopic diffusion efficiency adopted in stellar model computations. Methods: We consider stars with mass in the range [0.8-1.1] M{$\odot$} and evolutionary stages from the zero-age main sequence to the central hydrogen exhaustion. To recover the stellar parameters, a maximum-likelihood technique was employed by comparing the observations constraints to a precomputed grid of stellar models. Synthetic grids with perturbed input were adopted to estimate the systematic errors arising from the current uncertainty in model computations. Results: We found that the statistical error components, owing to the current typical uncertainty in the observations, are nearly constant in all cases at about 4.5\% and 2.2\% on mass and radius determination, respectively. The systematic bias on mass and radius determination due to a variation of {$\pm$} 1 in {$\Delta$}Y/{$\Delta$}Z is {$\pm$}2.3\% and {$\pm$} 1.1\%; the one due to a change of {$\pm$} 0.24 in the value of the mixing-length {$\alpha$}ml is {$\pm$} 2.1\% and {$\pm$} 1.0\%; the one due to a variation of {$\pm$} 5\% in the radiative opacity is {$\mp$} 1.0\% and {$\mp$} 0.45\%. An important bias source is to neglect microscopic diffusion, which accounts for errors of about 3.7\% and 1.5\% on mass and radius. The cumulative effects of the considered uncertainty sources can produce biased estimates of stellar characteristics. Comparison of the results of our technique with other grid techniques shows that the systematic biases induced by the differences in the estimation grids are generally greater than the statistical errors involved.

  abstract = {Context. Stellar age determination by means of grid-based techniques  that adopt asteroseismic constraints is a well established method nowadays. However some theoretical aspects of the systematic and statistical errors affecting these age estimates still have to be investigated. Aims: We study the impact on stellar age determination of the uncertainty in the radiative opacity, in the initial helium abundance, in the mixing-length value, in the convective core overshooting, and in the microscopic diffusion efficiency adopted in stellar model computations. Methods: We extended our SCEPtER grid to include stars with mass in the range [0.8; 1.6] M{$\odot$} and evolutionary stages from the zero-age main sequence to the central hydrogen depletion. For the age estimation we adopted the same maximum likelihood technique as described in our previous work. To quantify the systematic errors arising from the current uncertainty in model computations, many synthetic grids of stellar models with perturbed input were adopted. Results: We found that the current typical uncertainty in the observations accounts for 1{$\sigma$} statistical relative error in age determination, which on average ranges from about -35\% to +42\%, depending on the mass. However, owing to the strong dependence on the evolutionary phase, the age's relative error can be higher than 120\% for stars near the zero-age main sequence, while it is typically of the order of 20\% or lower in the advanced main-sequence phase. The systematic bias on age determination due to a variation of {$\pm$}1 in the helium-to-metal enrichment ratio {$\Delta$}Y/{$\Delta$}Z is about one-fourth of the statistical error in the first 30\% of the evolution, while it is negligible for more evolved stages. The maximum bias due to the presence of the convective core overshooting is -7\% and -13\% for mild and strong overshooting scenarios. For all the examined models, the impact of a variation of {$\pm$}5\% in the radiative opacity was found to be negligible. The most important source of bias is the uncertainty in the mixing-length value {$\alpha$}ml and the neglect of microscopic diffusion. Each of these effects accounts for a bias that is nearly equal to the random error uncertainty. Comparison of the results of our technique with other grid techniques on a set of common stars showed general agreement. However, the adoption of a different grid can account for a variation in the mean estimated age up to 1 Gyr. Appendices are available in electronic form at http://www.aanda.org},

In this work we use oscillation frequencies obtained using 2.5 yr of Kepler data to determine the current helium abundance of these stars. For this we use the fact that the helium ionization zone leaves a signature on the oscillation frequencies and that this signature can be calibrated to determine the helium abundance of that layer. By calibrating the signature of the helium ionization zone against models of known helium abundance, the helium abundance in the envelope of 16 Cyg A is found to lie in the range of 0.231 to 0.251 and that of 16 Cyg B lies in the range of 0.218 to 0.266.},

  abstract = {The advent of space-based observatories such as Convection, Rotation and  planetary Transits (CoRoT) and Kepler has enabled the testing of our understanding of stellar evolution on thousands of stars. Evolutionary models typically require five input parameters, the mass, initial helium abundance, initial metallicity, mixing length (assumed to be constant over time), and the age to which the star must be evolved. Some of these parameters are also very useful in characterizing the associated planets and in studying Galactic archaeology. How to obtain these parameters from observations rapidly and accurately, specifically in the context of surveys of thousands of stars, is an outstanding question, one that has eluded straightforward resolution. For a given star, we typically measure the effective temperature and surface metallicity spectroscopically and low-degree oscillation frequencies through space observatories. Here we demonstrate that statistical learning, using artificial neural networks, is successful in determining the evolutionary parameters based on spectroscopic and seismic measurements. Our trained networks show robustness over a broad range of parameter space, and critically, are entirely computationally inexpensive and fully automated. We analyse the observations of a few stars using this method and the results compare well to inferences obtained using other techniques. This method is both computationally cheap and inferentially accurate, paving the way for analysing the vast quantities of stellar observations from past, current, and future missions.},

We perform glitch analysis for all the 66 stars in the Kepler seismic LEGACY sample to derive the locations of the base of the envelope convection zone (CZ) and the helium ionization zone. The signature from helium ionization zone is found to be robust for all stars in the sample, whereas the CZ signature is found to be weak and problematic, particularly for relatively massive stars with large errorbars on the oscillation frequencies.

  abstract = {The structural stratification of a solar-type main-sequence star primarily depends on its mass and chemical composition. The surface heavy element abundances of the solar-type stars are reasonably well determined using conventional spectroscopy; however, the second most abundant element helium is not. This is due to the fact that the envelope temperature of such stars is not high enough to excite helium. Since the helium abundance of a star affects its structure and subsequent evolution, the uncertainty in the helium abundance of a star makes estimates of its global properties (mass, radius, age etc.) uncertain as well. The detections of the signatures of the acoustic glitches from the precisely measured stellar oscillation frequencies provide an indirect way to estimate the envelope helium content. We use the glitch signature caused by the ionization of helium to determine the envelope helium abundance of 38 stars in the Kepler seismic LEGACY sample. Our results confirm that atomic diffusion does indeed take place in solar-type stars. We use the measured surface abundances in combination with the settling predicted by the stellar models to determine the initial abundances. The initial helium and metal mass fractions have subsequently been used to get the preliminary estimates of the primordial helium abundance, Yp = 0.244 {$\pm$} 0.019, and the Galactic enrichment ratio, {$\Delta$}Y/{$\Delta$}Z = 1.226 {$\pm$} 0.849. Although the current estimates have large errorbars due to the limited sample size, this method holds great promises to determine these parameters precisely in the era of upcoming space missions.},

While conventionally the value of the mixing-length parameter, {$\alpha$}, used is the solar-calibrated value, many studies have shown that other values of {$\alpha$} are needed to properly model stars. This uncertainty in the value of the mixing-length parameter is a major source of error in stellar models and isochrones. Using asteroseismic data, we determine the value of the mixing-length parameter required to properly model a set of about 450 stars ranging in log g, \{T\}eff\vphantom\{\}, and [\{Fe\}/\{\{H\}\}]. The relationship between the value of {$\alpha$} required and the properties of the star is then investigated. For Eddington atmosphere, non-diffusion models, we find that the value of {$\alpha$} can be approximated by a linear model, in the form of {$\alpha$} /\{{$\alpha$} \}{$\odot$} =5.426\{--\}0.101 \{log\}(g)-1.071 \{log\}(\{T\}eff\vphantom\{\}) +0.437([\{Fe\}/\{\{H\}\}]).

We include in our analysis the helioseismic determinations of the surface helium abundance and of the depth of the convective envelope, the measurements of the 7Be and 8B neutrino fluxes, and the sound speed profile inferred from helioseismic frequencies. We provide all the ingredients to describe how these quantities depend on the solar surface composition, different from the initial and internal composition due to the effects of diffusion and nuclear reactions, and to evaluate the (correlated) uncertainties in solar model predictions. We include error sources that are not traditionally considered such as those from inversion of helioseismic data. We, then, apply the proposed approach to infer the chemical composition of the Sun. Our result is that the opacity profile of the Sun is well constrained by the solar observational properties. In the context of a two-parameter analysis in which elements are grouped as volatiles (i.e., C, N, O, and Ne) and refractories (i.e., Mg, Si, S, and Fe), the optimal surface composition is found by increasing the abundance of volatiles by (45 {$\pm$} 4)\% and that of refractories by (19 {$\pm$} 3)\% with respect to the values provided by Asplund et al. (2009, ARA\&A, 47, 481). This corresponds to the abundances {$\varepsilon$}O = 8.85 {$\pm$} 0.01 and {$\varepsilon$}Fe = 7.52 {$\pm$} 0.01, which are consistent at the \textasciitilde 1{$\sigma$} level with those provided by Grevesse \& Sauval (1998, SSRv, 85, 161). As an additional result of our analysis, we show that the best fit to the observational data is obtained with values of input parameters of the standard solar models (radiative opacities, gravitational settling rate, and the astrophysical factors S 34 and S 17) that differ at the \textasciitilde 1{$\sigma$} level from those presently adopted.},

The advantages our technique has over traditional analyses of color-magnitude diagrams are objectivity, precision, and explicit dependence on prior knowledge of cluster parameters. Within the confines of a given set of often-used models of stellar evolution, a single mapping of initial to final masses, and white dwarf cooling, and assuming photometric errors that one could reasonably achieve with the Hubble Space Telescope, our technique yields exceptional precision for even modest numbers of cluster stars. For clusters with 50\textendash 400 members and one to a few dozen white dwarfs, we find typical internal errors of  ({$\frac{1}{2}$}Fe/ H ) 0:03 dex,  (m \`A MV ) 0:02 mag, and  (AV ) 0:01 mag. We derive cluster white dwarf ages with internal errors of typically only 10\% for clusters with only three white dwarfs and almost always 5\% with 10 white dwarfs. These exceptional precisions will allow us to test white dwarf cooling models and standard stellar evolution models through observations of white dwarfs in open and globular clusters.},

Generally, our knowledge of isotopic abundances of stars is fairly incomplete except for the Sun. We present a first model for a complete average isotopic decomposition as a function of metallicity. Our model is based on the underlying nuclear astrophysics processes, and is fitted to observational data, rather than traditional forward galactic chemical evolution modeling which integrates stellar yields beginning from big bang nucleosynthesis. We first decompose the isotopic solar abundance pattern into contributions from astrophysical sources. Each contribution is then assumed to scale as a function of metallicity. The resulting total isotopic abundances are summed into elemental abundances and fitted to available halo and disk stellar data to constrain the model's free parameter values. This procedure allows us to use available elemental observational data to reconstruct and constrain both the much needed complete isotopic evolution that is not accessible to current observations, and the underlying astrophysical processes. As an example, our model finds a best fit for Type Ia contributing \textasciitilde = 0.7 to the solar Fe abundance, and Type Ia onset occurring at [Fe/H] \textasciitilde = -1.1, in agreement with typical values.},

The relationships between these asteroseismic observables, such as the separations between mode frequencies, are able to significantly constrain estimates of the ages and masses of these stars. We investigate the scaling relation between the large frequency separation, {$\Delta\nu$}, and mean stellar density. Furthermore we present model evolutionary tracks for several asteroseismic diagrams. We have extended the so-called C-D diagram beyond the main sequence to the subgiants and the red giant branch. We also consider another asteroseismic diagram, the epsilon diagram, which is more sensitive to variations in stellar properties at the subgiant stages and can aid in determining the correct mode identification. The recent discovery of gravity-mode period spacings in red giants forms the basis for a third asteroseismic diagram. We compare the evolutionary model tracks in these asteroseismic diagrams with results from pre-Kepler studies of solar-like oscillations and early results from Kepler.},

  abstract = {flowMC is a Python library for accelerated Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) leveraging deep generative modeling. It is built on top of the machine learning libraries JAX and Flax. At its core, flowMC uses a local sampler and a learnable global sampler in tandem to efficiently sample posterior distributions. While multiple chains of the local sampler generate samples over the region of interest in the target parameter space, the package uses these samples to train a normalizing flow model, then uses it to propose global jumps across the parameter space. The flowMC sampler can handle non-trivial geometry, such as multimodal distributions and distributions with local correlations. The key features of flowMC are summarized in the following list: * Since flowMC is built on top of JAX, it supports gradient-based samplers through automatic differentiation such as MALA and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC). * flowMC uses state-of-the-art normalizing flow models such as Rational-Quadratic Splines to power its global sampler. These models are very efficient in capturing important features within a relatively short training time. * Use of accelerators such as GPUs and TPUs are natively supported. The code also supports the use of multiple accelerators with SIMD parallelism. * By default, Just-in-time (JIT) compilations are used to further speed up the sampling process. * We provide a simple black box interface for the users who want to use flowMC by its default parameters, yet provide at the same time an extensive guide explaining trade-offs while tuning the sampler parameters. The tight integration of all the above features makes flowMC a highly performant yet simple- to-use package for statistical inference.},

We estimate systematic effects on the inferred global Gaia parallax offset, c, due to radius and temperature systematics, as well as choices in bolometric correction and the adopted form for Gaia parallax spatial correlations. Because of possible spatially correlated parallax errors, as discussed by the Gaia team, our Gaia parallax offset model is specific to the Kepler field, but broadly compatible with the magnitude- and color-dependent offset inferred by the Gaia team and several subsequent investigations using independent methods.},
